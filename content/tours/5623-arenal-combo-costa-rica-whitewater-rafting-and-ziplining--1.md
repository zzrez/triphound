advice: "LOGISTICS:Our Arenal Combo Rafting-Ziplining departs at 9am from Downtown La Fortuna, but the exact pick up time depends upon the location of your hotel. We first start with an exciting rafting trip on the Balsa River class 2-3 about 45 minutes from La Fortuna. Once at the river you'll get your equipment, safety speech and do some practice moves, then you will spend around 2 hours paddling downriver.

Once you finish up rafting, we'll take you back toward La Fortuna (about 25 minutes ride) and have a delicious homemade lunch. After lunch, we will take you back to town and another van will take you straight to your Ecoglide Ziplining tour. Once at the Ziplining tour, you will be zipping along for an hour and 45 minutes tour and be back in your hotel between 5:00 to 5:30 pm.Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies and this Costa Rica combo rafting ziplining tour.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours.NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up"

Arenal Combo Tour: Class 2-3 Whitewater Rafting and Canopy Ziplining

Get a double dose of adrenaline in La Fortuna with whitewater rafting and ziplining in Costa Rica! Travel to Arenal's Río Balsa and challenge yourself with class 2-3 rapids as you whitewater raft down the Balsa River. The Rio Balsa is a fun Costa Rica rafting trip with rapids called “Morning Coffee” & “Rock around the Croc!” You are sure to have an unforgettable Costa Rica rafting adventure! Play around in tranquil river pools, take in the breathtaking scenery, and ride the waves of the Balsa River for about two hours along 10 kilometers of lush Costa Rican rainforest.

Then, start the second leg of your day with your Arenal ziplining tour. This canopy zipline adventure will take you on a total of 13 exciting cables throughout this well-thought-out adventure park. The first cable is only 25 meters long, intended to help you feel comfortable with your gear and get you ready to enjoy the rest of the cables of this adventure sport. The thrill of the zip increases from cable to cable until you arrive to cable number 12. This is the longest cable and is an exciting 430 meters long -- that's over 1,200 feet long!

Along the way, you'll have the opportunity to do a unique and exciting Tarzan Swing! You'll love this part of the tour, almost as much as you'll love the 360 degree panoramic view of the rainforest that you'll have as you fly above the lush canopy at the base of the Arenal Volcano.

You’ll finish off this fun-filled day with a delicious traditional lunch at a charming rural location.Two of the best adventure activities in the Arenal, La Fortuna area.
