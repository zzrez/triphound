Arenal to Monteverde Boat Transfer Coffee & Chocolate Tour Adventure Connection

Take the most-efficient and most-personalized means of travel between the Arenal Vocano and the cloud forests of Monteverde. This transfer service starts with one of our friendly drivers stopping by your La Fortuna hotel to pick you up. The driver then helps you load up your luggage as you take your seat in our comfortable, air-conditioned van. You'll drive past the Arenal Volcano and over the earthen dam along the pristine, Lake Arenal.

Your driver will then help unload your luggage and assist you as you walk down a rather steep, cement ramp to get to the large, pontoon-style, comfortable boat on Lake Arenal. Your boat is roof-covered and safe and equipped with life-jackets and a knowledgeable, friendly Lake Arenal boat captain.

Your Lake Arenal boat captain will then start up the motor and you'll have a leisurely boat ride along the smooth, calm and very picturesque Lake Arenal with great views of the Arenal Volcano. You'll also have amazing birdwatching opportunities along the way as you pass by isolated, remote Lake Arenal islands filled with herons, cormorants, anhingas -- you might even be able to spot an elusive river otter or coaties along the way.

Once you get to the other side of Lake Arenal, there will be another van waiting for you for this stretch of the Costa Rica transportation. Your boat captain will try to point you in the right direction. Please be sure to grab all your luggage and make your way to the correct van for your journey up to Monteverde. Hold on to your seats, because the ride up to Monteverde is a bit bumpy, but still a gorgeous drive with Kodak moments around every corner. You might even get a view of

one of Monteverde's famous rainbows that stretch across the green, lush rainforest valleys of Monteverde.

You'll stop along the way at the Don Juan Coffee & Chocolate farm for a thoroughly enjoyable and informative tour to learn the whole process and history of Costa Rica coffee and chocolate. You will even participate in picking some beans and experience the whole coffee toasting and roasting process. Of course you'll be able to imbibe in some delicious Costa Rica coffee straight from the farm and amazing chocolate. Have a nice lunch on site and then you will be taken to the doorstep of your Monteverde hotel to check-in.

Enjoy the fresh, clear air and rustic elegance of this beautiful Costa Rica mountain town. There's plenty to see and do in Monteverde -- especially delicious restaurants to horse rides on well-taken-care-of horses and other famous Costa Rica adventure tours such as canopy zip line tours.

Desaf√≠o Adventure Company has a sister office called Monteverde Adventure Company where you can enjoy a quiet rest in our Monkey Park - you're bound to see playful white-faced, capuccino monkeys up in the trees above our office.

The Monteverde Express boat transfer is a more-private service while the normal Taxi Boat Taxi or Jeep-Boat-Jeep is a similar, but less-expensive option and cannot be made into a COMBO tour.

We charge an additional pick up and/or drop off fee for a few La Fortuna hotels located outside our normal pick up areas. Let us know where you need to be picked up and dropped off for your Monteverde transfer and we will tell you if any additional charges are involved.

And be sure to let us know if you need help with making reservations at any of our beautiful Monteverde hotels. And once you leave Monteverde, be sure to sign up for our Adventure Connection Transfer + Tour to your choice of Guanacaste beach location and do rafting or a safari float along the way or try our daily shuttles to Manuel Antonio Costa Rica! We offer the best prices for transport in Monteverde.
