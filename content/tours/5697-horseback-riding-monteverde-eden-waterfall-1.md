Horseback Riding to Eden Waterfall in Monteverde

Would you like to see the REAL Monteverde Cloud Forest and experience an amazing waterfall hidden deep in the forest?

Ride horseback in Costa Rica through the countryside of Monteverde to see amazing scenery, mountains, old growth trees and interesting wildlife. The trail is very narrow and steep, so experience horseback riding is recommended. When you reach the entrance to the Eden waterfall, dismount your horses and hike down approximately an hour and a half to the spectacular 30-meter waterfall.

This is one of our favorite waterfalls in Costa Rica!

You will have an opportunity to cool off in the refreshing waters and take lots of photos. When you are ready, hike back up to your horses and enjoy the amazing view at the top. On a clear day you can even see views of the Pacific Ocean from way up high!

Ride for another two and a half hours, breaking to see beautiful wildlife and hummingbirds. Bring a little extra spending money in case you would like to stop to buy a cup of coffee or a refreshing drink.

This is the perfect tour for experienced horseback riders, adventure seekers, and nature lovers!
