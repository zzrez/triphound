advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 8-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Boat, Snorkel & Hike in Cahuita National Park

On the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica sits the protected Cahuita National Park, best described as a nature lover’s playground full of land and sea adventures. The Cahuita Boat, Snorkel and Hiking trip provides you with some of the best activities in Costa Rica – a boat tour on the Caribbean ocean to a famous snorkeling site that sits by the coral reef, followed by a rainforest hike in Cahuita National Park.

You’ll start your adventure off at the beach, climbing on board the boat that will take you through the ocean to the coral reef. You will then have two glorious hours in two different parts of the National Park to snorkel in the refreshing ocean. You’ll get to see a colorful exhibit of underwater creatures that live in the aquamarine waters, as well as interesting underwater terrain and coral formations.

Then, you’ll fuel up with a topical fruit fiesta on the beach before heading out on your hike through the coastal rainforest. Since the National Park is he home to an abundance and diversity of wildlife, the chance are good that you’ll get to see some: monkeys, tropical birds, sloths, iguanas, poisonous dart frogs and other interesting creatures are commonly spotted by visitors. Your eagle-eyed guide will be sure to point out hidden wildlife and tell you all you need to know about the rainforest of Costa Rica and in Cahuita National Park.
