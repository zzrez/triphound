advice: "Extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone. Please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing. For Nosara or Punta Islita Beaches: extra charge $30.

Our river trips run rain or shine – you’re going to get wet anyway!! If river conditions are unsuitable for the Río Tenorio, our head guide might make the call to change to a back-up river of a similar level and/or offer another tour – you're always guaranteed a fun, but safe day! You get a full refund if no tour is run."
