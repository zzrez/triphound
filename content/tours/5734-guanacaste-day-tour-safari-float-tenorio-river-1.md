For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Guanacaste Day Tour: Safari Float on the Tenorio River

Enjoy the tranquility of the lower section of the Tenorio River on this easy-going, safari float! This is the ultimate activity for nature lovers of all ages, especially children as a One-Day tour from Guanacaste! It’s also perfect for couples or large groups who want to spend some quality time and relax together in the middle of a tropical paradise!

Your eagle-eyed guide will paddle and steer your raft as he points out many species of plants and animals that live in the jungle. Spot howler monkeys, lizards, crocodiles, and even river otters, plus an incredible amount of tropical birds such as ospreys, boat-billed herons, parrots, and kingfishers.

About half way down the river, you be able to see the river from land, as you pull over to the side and snack on some refreshing tropical fruit and icy cold spring water.

Then, make your way down the rest of the river where an open air-4x4 jeep will be waiting for you! Hop on board and ride on the bumpy back road through the scenic landscape until you reach a local restaurant where you’ll sit down to a delicious Costa Rican lunch! What a perfect day!
