On this intense and fun day you get to experience all of la Fortunas nature to the fullest. We start the hike going up a steep jungle trail that takes us to the top of the Chato Volcano. After lunch we go down the Chato on the opposite side. The hiking gets lighter as we cross farmland to make it to the observatory park.

Here you pass two hanging bridges and visit the Danta river and waterfall. Along the way your guide will explains about the ecosystem, the volcanoes and the animals you can see. Among others we often see monkeys and tropical birds. Leaving the forest we reach the Arenal Observatory. In its little museum you can see the seismograph and we explain more about the volcano.

We finish the hike at the deck of the Observatory lodge. Here we enjoy the panoramic view of the volcano and Arenal Lake till the sun goes down. Transportation will be ready to take us down. On our way we will try to find the red eyed tree frog. To finish the tour in the most relaxing way we take you to the natural hot water river. We relax in its soothing warm water for about an hour and you can enjoy a volcanic mud facial and a complementary cocktail.

At about 8pm you�ll be back at your hotel to end your full la Fortuna experience.
