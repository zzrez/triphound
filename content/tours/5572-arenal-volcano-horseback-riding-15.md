Featuring the Arenal Volcano and its surrounding rainforest as the main natural scenery, at our horseback riding camp you can enjoy a key nature tour for your Costa Rican vacation, on very well tended horses. After horseback riding lessons or instruction as needed, you will be ready to ride the trails, including a rainforest portion where howler monkeys and birds can be seen. The tour also visits the Arenal Volcano scenic point, to appreciate the magnificence of the volcano and one of the beautiful lakes that it originated at its flanks.

The guide conducting the ride carries a first-aid kit at all times, and motorized assistance is available by radio communication.
