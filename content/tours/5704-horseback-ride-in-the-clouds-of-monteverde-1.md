advice: "Please let us know your riding abilities and weight so we can get you properly fitted for your horse and saddle for the Monteverde horseback riding tour.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Horseback Ride in the Clouds of Monteverde

Take a four-hour horseback ride In Monteverde along rustic country backroads that sit parallel to the continental divide of Costa Rica. On a clear day, you may be able to see the Arenal Volcano, and on the other side is the Pacific Ocean outside of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. Take in the gorgeous Costa Rican countryside and views of the Nicoya Peninsula.

You’ll get a good feel for authentic, rural Costa Rica. Now’s the time to freshen up on your Spanish with your Costa Rican cowboy as you see Toucans, monkeys and more! The length of the tour allows us to get deep into the farming community with a great opportunity to see the land use of the area, well away from the tourist areas.
