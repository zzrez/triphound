advice: "We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.

For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."

Guanacaste Day Tour: Monteverde Selvatura Hanging Bridges & Butterfly Hummingbird Gardens with Lunch

Selvatura's Tree Top Hanging Bridges is one tour that you don't want to miss in Monteverde! See the Monteverde Cloud Forest from a bird's perspective while walking on the hanging bridges that are suspended from tree to tree. These bridges are some of the longest one in the country, providing almost 2 miles of walking and exploring. Each bridge is of varying lengths- from 50 to 170 meters long and up to 60 meters high. This is a great tour for everyone, especially children who are too young for ziplining and people who want to take their time to soak in the beautiful cloud forest. On this guided hike, your naturalist guide will tell you all you need to know about Monteverde, it's nature, and it's natural history. Your guide who has a keen eye for seeing hidden creatures, will point out wildlife and be able to name the different kinds of birds that fly by and the different kinds of interesting exotic plants that you will see. You will love it!

Next, check out the most expansive butterfly and hummingbird gardens in Northern Costa Rica! You’ll see butterflys of all colors- red, orange, yellow, and lots of Blue Morphos, Costa Rica’s national butterfly. Your guide will take you through the gardens, pointing out the different species and telling you fun facts about these interesting creatures. The hummingbird garden is also a sight to see. There are fifteen different species of hummingbirds that are housed in this beautiful open area. Come watch these colorful and beautiful birds quietly darting from feeder to feeder, flower to flower. Finish this adventure and nature filled day with a delicious lunch, before being driven back to your Guanacaste hotel!
