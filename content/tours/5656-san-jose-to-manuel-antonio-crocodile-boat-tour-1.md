San Jose to Manuel Antonio Crocodile Boat Tour - try our Desafio Adventure Connection to make the most of your journey from San Jose to Manuel Antonio!

Desafío Adventure Company continues to innovate and come up with great ways for you to enjoy tours on the way to your next destination. That's why we have added the Desafío Adventure Connection with a stop at the Tarcoles River for a Crocodile Safari Boat tour on the way.

This is best way to get to Manuel Antonio to break up this 3 hour drive, because you're bound to see a multitude of wildlife including the famous, huge, 20-ft American crocodiles that inhabit the Carara Biological Reserve area of the Tarcioles River. Keep your eyes peeled for a rare sighting of the Scarlet Macaw and over fifty other species of birds you can see there. Plus, if you're traveling with children, they'll get a kick out of the "Jesus Christ Lizards" that literally walk on water here.

The industrial Río Virilla river originating near the capital city of San José later joins the Río Grande to form the Tarcoles River and flows southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the river mouth near Jaco's Herradura Beach.

You'll be accompanied by a bilingual guide who will point out the often difficult-to-see wildlife along this two-hour boat tour of the Tarcoles River and into the Guacalillo mangrove estuary.Enjoy a delicious lunch at the end of the tour!

Your whole family will love this entertaining and informative tour at one of Costa Rica's most-complex ecosystems. You're bound to see more crocodiles here than anywhere else in the world!
