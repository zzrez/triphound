advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiverif you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 8-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Guided Hike in the Monteverde Cloud Forest

Monteverde Reserve is located on the Continental Divide, the boarder between the Pacific and Atlantic sides of Costa Rica. On a clear day you can see the Pacific ocean from way up high in the mountains, even though it is miles away!

The varied climates and high latitudes of this cloud forest reserve help keep this vast biodiversity of plant and animal life going: There are jaguars, black guans, ocelots, emerald toucanets, threewattled bellbirds, barenecked umbrella bird, blue-crowned motmots, quetzals, hummingbirds, and tens of thousands of insects to see and learn about. Your tour guide will be sure to point out the interesting wildlife that you may be lucky enough to see!

You will have the opportunity to explore the nine different paths that weave through the cloud forest, eventually arriving at one of the highest points of the reserve. This point is nicknamed “La Ventana”, meaning “the window” for a reason: it continues to set people in awe with the crystal clear view of the gorgeous mountains, trees and huge sky that surrounds them.

Onward during your hike, you will arrive at the Wilford Guindon hanging bridges that stretches over 325 ft above the tree tops. This is where you will have the opportunity to look down over rivers and forest and see a number of interesting plants and flower species, such as the bromeliads, orchids, ferns, vines and mosses.

This is more than just a nature hike, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience to enjoy the unique cloud forest and all of it’s inhabitants!
