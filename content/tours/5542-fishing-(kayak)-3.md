Developed over 4000 years ago by the Inuit, Yup'ik and Aleut Eskimos of the Bering Sea and the Arctic, North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, Kayaks were designed specifically for fishing. These sleek, silent crafts provide a stable and lightweight vessel from which to cast your inshore fishing lines as you stealthily troll the calm Pacific waters in the Golf of Nicoya, just off the beautiful coast of Playa Agujas with your professional, bilingual kayak fishing guide.

Each bite from the bountiful natural supply of Bonita, Groupers, Snappers, Corvinas, Mackerels & Jacks is made all the more exciting when you are fishing from a Kayak. Should you be lucky enough to hook one of the toughest fighters of them all - the exotic, muscular Roosterfish - the thrill of kayak fishing in Costa Rica will be a memory you treasure for a lifetime. We will provide the fishing, but please note that we can make no guarantees that you will catch fish.

This 3 hour excursion has both a morning and an afternoon start time to fit easily into your schedule.
