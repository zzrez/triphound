Palo Verde National Park Boat Tour & Guatil Pottery Visit

Looking for an interesting thing to do in Guanacaste during your Costa Rica vacation? We highly recommend taking a day to do the Palo Verde National Park boat tour and visit to the Guaitil Potterry-making workshop.

We’ll pick you up from your Samara Beach or Guanacaste hotel and drive through the Costa Rican countryside, seeing gorgeous scenery and the small villages that reside just off the main roads.

On the way to the Palo Verde National Park, we will stop in Guaitil, the home of many talented artisans who showcase their work all around Costa Rica. You might have seen their work in souvenir shops, and now you will get to see how the work is done first-hand. An artisan will show you how to turn natural clay into a useful or decorative object and you will realize how natural and important this ancient process is in Costa Rican culture.

Next, you’ll head to Palo Verde National Park, a wildlife refuge that encompasses more than 10,000 square hectares located between the Tempisque and Bebedero rivers. When you arrive at the edge of the river, you’ll hop on board a comfortable, covered motorized boat and make your way down the river with an experienced nature guide. Your guide will point out various types of wildlife like birds, iguanas, lizards, monkeys and even crocodiles! When your tour is over, you will be taken to a delicious restaurant to enjoy a traditional Costa Rican lunch.
