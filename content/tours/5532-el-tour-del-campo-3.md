Our Rainforest Tour Del Campo begins with an ascent through secondary rainforest, crossing over creeks, passing a beautiful rolling waterfall, taking you through a majestic teak farm, and cresting at sweeping ocean panoramas.

You will continue on through the Costa Rican countryside, passing through the charming Pueblo of Bijagual tucked away behind the mountains of the famous Carara National Park.

Kick back and take in the peace of this secret paradise.

In our comfortable custom-modified 4x4 safari vehicles, and with your informative professional English-speaking guide, you will continue on to our secret little Costa Rican paradise.

Paz del Campo (closed Tuesdays - delicious alternative offered) is both a secluded high-end Costa Rican restaurant, and a well-kept tilapia farm. Owner Don Gerardo takes great pride in both his farm, as well as his authentic Costa Rican cuisine.

Kick back and take in the peace of this secret paradise, or try your hand at fishing fresh tilapia fish from the pond that surrounds while waiting for your delicious meal (included).

After your great meal, you are back on the road passing one last time through the gorgeous Costa Rican landscapes, and overlooks.

We end the tour with the 2000ft descent back to sea level and Adventure Tours Costa Rica’s headquarters in Jaco Beach.

Just another day in paradise!
