advice: "While the recommended weight limit for most zip line tours is 270 lbs (122 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 270 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. If you are a little over 270 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours.Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition. Ask about our other ziplining tours in Arenal."

Sky Adventures: Zipline, Gondola and Hanging Bridges in Arenal, Costa Rica

Sky Trek’s ziplining, hanging bridges and gondola tour is the perfect way to get you up close and personal with the interesting scenery and the breathtaking views Arenal, Costa Rica has to offer! Get lifted high into the mountain by an open-air gondola to an observation platform where you will begin your adrenaline-pumping journey “zipping” above the rainforest canopy! Then, soak up some more nature as you walk above the treetops on the hanging bridges! A great all-in-one nature and adventure tour while visiting La Fortuna.

Come and see the rainforest from new heights- literally! We’ll pick you up from your Arenal hotel and take you to Sky Adventures Arenal headquarters to embark on an adventure of a lifetime!

Start your day off with a tranquil, scenic experience above the rainforest canopy with a guided walk across the Sky Walk hanging bridges. Designed for birdwatchers and nature lovers alike, the hanging bridges offer stunning views of the rainforest and its inhabitants. Walk across a series of bridges that are up to 30 feet high with our experienced naturalist guides who will point out wildlife, plant species and offer fun facts about Costa Rica!

Then take a relaxing ride up the mountain by an open-air gondola. The breathtaking view will get wider and even more breathtaking as you get higher up the mountain. When you reach the observation platform at the top, you’ll realize that you really are in for a treat. There, you will begin your adrenaline-pumping journey zipping through the rainforest: flying like a bird from tree-to-tree, over canyons and through 1.7 miles of zipline cables! Admire the amazing nature on your Costa Rica ziplining journey across 8 cables that reach up to 660 feet and are up to 2460 feet long. You won’t want to miss out on a ziplining in Costa Rica adventure like this!
