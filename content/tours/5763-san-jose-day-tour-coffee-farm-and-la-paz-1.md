San Jose Day Tour: Coffee Plantation and La Paz Waterfall Area

See as much of Costa Rica as you can while you're here! Enjoy a day of fun filled adventure while visiting three of Costa Rica’s most beautiful sites. Take an exciting day trip during your stay in San Jose. Enjoy an interesting tour at a coffee plantation where you will learn about the history and importance of coffee in Costa Rican culture and try a traditional Costa Rican lunch. Pass by the recently-very active Poas Volcano off in the distance. Finish the day outside the La Paz waterfall where you'll be able to take pictures of the breathtaking falls, birds, butterflies, monkeys, and sloths that have been spotted there.

First, we’ll drive up the mountains close to the Poas Volcano.You’ll notice a change in altitude as the temperature gets cooler and the type of vegetation changes - there are a lot of coffee, flower, fern and strawberry plantations higher in the mountains.

On the way to the volcano, we’ll visit a coffee plantation and learn about the ancient techniques of planting, harvesting and processing coffee, as well as the importance of coffee production in Costa Rica. We’ll finish the tour off with a delicious cup of coffee and a traditional lunch.

We’ll continue on our adventure and to the beautiful La Paz waterfall for an incredible photo op before continuing on to San Jose.

This tour is perfect for people of all ages.
