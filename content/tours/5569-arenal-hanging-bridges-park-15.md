An easy, family friendly tour in 250 hectares of protected land, with everything taken care of for you! We will meet you at your location of choice and from there head into the park. As we pull into the parking lot (weather dependant) one of the most beautiful views Arenal Volcano will come into sight.

Your guide will join you on the hike to help you get the most out of your 3km walk and with their experienced eye they will point out things you may never have known to look for on your own! The hanging bridges are built in a primary rainforest, which is extremely rich in vegetation, home to many species of birds, 3 different species of monkeys, wild boars, many kinds of reptiles and more!

The bridges vary from small ones over creeks to the highest one being 60 meters high taking you through the treetops of the forest! The longest bridge, Tyra Bridge is 98 meters long! About half way through the walk there is a beautiful waterfall that you can take a trail down to and enjoy its beauty up close. See the rainforest from every level! All the way on the ground right up into the tree tops all on this easy, guided tour!
