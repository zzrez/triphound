Manuel Antonio to Monteverde Crocodile Boat Tour - a perfect Adventure Connection option to do a Crocodile Boat Tour in the way!

Desafío Adventure Company continues to innovate and come up with great ways for you to enjoy tours on the way to your next destination with our Costa Rica transport options like our Adventure Connections.

We have created a Desafío Adventure Connection with a stop at the Tarcoles River for a Crocodile Safari Boat tour on the way from Manuel Antonio to the Monteverde Cloud Forest. This is door to door service as we pick you up in your hotel in Manuel Antonio and do a transport from Manuel Antonio to Monteverde and stop along the way to do a Crocodile Boat tour. What a great way to travel!

This Manuel Antonio transfer option breaks up the long 5-hour drive from the Manuel Antonio beach, because you're bound to see a multitude of wildlife including the famous, huge, 20-ft American crocodiles that inhabit the Carara Biological Reserve area of the Tarcoles River.

Keep your eyes peeled for a rare sighting of the Scarlet Macaw and over fifty other species of birds you can see there.

Plus, if you're traveling with children, they'll get a kick out of the "Jesus Christ Lizards" that literally walk on water here.

The industrial Río Virilla river originating near the capital city of San José later joins the Río Grande to form the Tarcoles River and flows southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the river mouth near Jacó's Herradura Beach.

You'll be accompanied by a bilingual guide who will point out the often difficult-to-see wildlife along this two-hour boat tour of the Tarcoles River and into the Guacalillo mangrove estuary.

Your whole family will love this entertaining and informative tour at one of Costa Rica's most-complex ecosystems. You're bound to see more crocodiles here than anywhere else in the world!
