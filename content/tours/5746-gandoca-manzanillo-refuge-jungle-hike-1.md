The Gandoca-Manzanillo Refuge Jungle Hike

A great way to see the amazing and lush Caribbean rainforests of Costa Rica. You’ll see trees covered with lichen, bromeliads, orchids and mosses creating an abundance of life and beauty. There are around 384 species of birds that exist in the forest and your nature guide will point different species like hummingbirds, tanagers, owls and toucans.

You may also see different types of wildlife like white-faced monkeys, howler monkeys, sloths, iguanas, snakes, poisonous frogs, and many other types of animals.

You will learn about the many types of medicinal plants that are native to Costa Rica, learn about the natural history, and understand Afro-Caribbean customs.

On your way back, you can stop and enjoy a delicious Caribbean meal at the popular restaurant Maxi’s at your own cost before we head to the beach!

All of our guides speak both English and Spanish, but you may wish to request one of our French and German speaking guides.
