At a suspension bridge that is 262 meters long, you will walk over the beautiful Sarapiqui River and observe the flora and fauna that is hidden in the treetops. During the walk you will be traveling upon 9 km (5.5 miles) of trails suited to be accessible to people of all ages. This system of trails is within a protected area that consists of over 346 acres of magnificent tropical forest. In the company of a local guide, you will begin the journey in the gardens of the reserve and as you hike you will discover the many wonders of the rainforest and the different habitats that the animals of the forest inhabit.

The lowlands of the Caribbean are well known for the high biodiversity in their forests. Within the reserve are 420 species of birds, 89 species of mammals of which 59 are bats, 30 species of amphibians, and 35 species of reptiles. During the journey you will learn a little about the natural history and importance of some of these species both flora and fauna and gain a whole new appreciation for the rain forest. The walk will last approximately two and a half hours and ends in the same place where you start.
