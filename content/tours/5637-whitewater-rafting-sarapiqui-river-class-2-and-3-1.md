Whitewater Rafting Sarapiqui River class 2 and 3

Get ready for one of our favorite Arenal tours -- a fun day white water rafting in Costa Rica on the Sarapqiui River. Our class 2-3 section is perfect for families, children and first time rafters who are looking for just the right level of excitement on a white water rafting vacation in Costa Rica.

You'll go white water rafting down a series of over 20 fun and rolling rapids, surrounded by some of Costa Rica's most incredible, deep jungle scenery. The Sarapiqui River is an Arenal tour only about 1 hour from the Arenal Volcano and works well as a day trip from La Fortuna, San José or the Caribbean Coast. We will pick you up from your hotel in the Arenal Volcano area and arrive to the La Virgen public river put in. You'll receive a thorough safety talk, get set with top-quality equipment such as a helmet, lifejacket and paddle and team up on a 3 to 6-person raft. You'll do a bit of a practice before heading down river. Spot monkeys, sloths, toucans and much more along the way.

Enjoy a nice fruit break and a swim along the way and end this fun Costa Rica adventure tour by having a nice pack lunch at our riverside restaurant the Red Eyed Frog.

Families with children are welcome to join our class 2-3 rafting on the Sarapiqui River. It's a great choice for small groups and friends looking for a high-quality, full-day adventure.

Allow us to help you find the tours that best suit your schedule and ability level, and get ready for an adrenaline rush on one of the best whitewater rafting adventures in the country.

Desafio Adventure Company is a professional, fully-licensed outfitter with internationally-experienced guides. We will ensure a safe and seriously fun adventure!
