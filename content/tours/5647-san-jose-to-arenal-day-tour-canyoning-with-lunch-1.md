advice: "Recommended ages 13-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

San Jose to Arenal Day Tour: Canyoning and Lunch

Canyoning is one of the coolest sports to do in Costa Rica. The rugged, mountainous terrain near the Arenal Volcano is the perfect place for first-timers and experienced Canyoning enthusiasts to hike deep into the rainforest and rappel massive waterfalls â€“ the largest waterfall is over 200ft high!

We will pick you up from your San Jose Hotel and drive about 2.5 hours to the Arenal Volcano area. From there you'll head to Desafio's Lost Canyon and get to rappel, hike, down-climb and river trace. After your tour, change your clothes and have lunch in the Desafio Canyon House.

After a fun day exploring the Arenal Volcano, we will pick you up and drive you back to your hotel in San Jose in our comfortable, air conditioned vans equipped with FREE WiFi.
