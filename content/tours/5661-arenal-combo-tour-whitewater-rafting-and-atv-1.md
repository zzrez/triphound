Arenal COMBO Tour: Whitewater Rafting Class 2-3 and ATV Tour with Lunch

You'll start off at a private farm next to the Arenal Volcano National Park. You will be given safety instructions as well as have a chance to warm up in an open space. During this ATV Tour you will travel through rainforest trails, farms and alongside rivers. Your bilingual guide will point out interesting plants and exotic wildlife and let you stop and take pictures! This is a great ride for beginners and advanced ATV enthusiasts, or those who want to explore the beautiful and varied landscapes of the Arenal Region.

When your ATV adventure is finished, you will heading back to town and we will take you on your next adventure: Rafting Balsa River Class 2-3. Rafting in Costa Rica is a little different than other parts of the world because the rivers here have steep gradients, lots of rapids and are a little more technical and shallow, which make for lots of fun and adventure!

Challenge yourself by paddling down over 10 kilometers of continuous, exciting rapids with names like "Congo Loco" and "Rock around the Croc!"

As you descend down this beautiful class 2-3 river, you'll have a chance to admire the lush greenery, vines, and different types of insects, birds and animals -- your eagle-eyed guide will even point out the monkeys, sloths and toucans along the way!

About half way down the river your guides will provide you a smorgasbord of fresh tropical fruit as you relax with the rest of your group. Take a swim and immerse yourself in the wild nature around you!

When your rafting adventure is finished, enjoy a typical Costa Rican lunch at charming rural location. After your day full of nature, adventure, and delicious food, weâ€™ll drive you back to your La Fortuna hotel on our comfortable, air-conditioned vans with FREE WiFi!
