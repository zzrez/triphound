El Trapiche Sugarcane Mill Tour in Monteverde

The El Trapiche tour is perfect for those looking to learn a bit of Costa Rican culture.

Get your hiking boots on and prepare for a long but easy-going hike, exploring all of the exotic treats grown here in Costa Rica. As you walk through you will see a variety crops, as well as Tilapia fish, you will get to pick coffee and even get to enjoy an ox-cart ride -- just like a local "Tico" Costa Rican!

At the end of the Trapiche Sugarcane Mill tour, you will get to see the sugar cane pressing process and make sugar cane candy. And don't miss out on trying the freshly-pressed sugarcane juice, lemonade and picadillo de arracache. A true taste of Monteverde!

This is a great way to see the sites and flavors of Monteverde and experience a true Costa Rica Cultural tour!
