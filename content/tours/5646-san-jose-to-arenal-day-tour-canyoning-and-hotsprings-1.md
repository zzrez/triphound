advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 13-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

San Jose to Arenal Day Tour: Canyoning, Lunch, Hot Springs & Dinner

Canyoning is one of the coolest sports to do in Costa Rica. The rugged, mountainous terrain near the Arenal Volcano is the perfect place for first-timers and experienced canyoning enthusiasts to hike deep into the rainforest and rappel massive waterfalls â€“ the largest waterfall is over 200ft high!

We will pick you up from your San Jose Hotel and drive about 2.5 hours to the Arenal Volcano area. From there you'll head to Desafio's Lost Canyon and get to rappel, hike, down-climb and river trace. After your tour, change your clothes and get ready for lunch.

We'll take you the hot springs to relax your muscles after your big workout! The hot springs are heated from the Arenal Volcano and normally are decked out with gardens, beautiful Costa Rican waterfalls and swim-up bars to buy wine or cocktails. After your dip, you'll be invited to change your clothes and dry off before eating dinner and heading back to San Jose.

After a fun day exploring the Arenal Volcano, we will drive you back to your hotel in San Jose in our comfortable, air conditioned vans equipped with FREE WiFi.
