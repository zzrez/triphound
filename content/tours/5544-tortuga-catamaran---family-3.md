The day begins with a state-of-the-art, air-conditioned bus ride to Costa Rica’s largest Pacific Port in Puntarenas. A delicious traditional Costa Rican breakfast will be waiting for you on your arrival to this historic port town.

Once on board the Catamaran, you will be treated to delicious tropical fruit plates, soft drinks and fruit juice. The adults in your group will have the option to purchase alcoholic beverages from the catamaran’s full bar!

Kayaking, fishing and hiking are also available on Tortuga Island for a small, additional fee.
