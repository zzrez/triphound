advice: "We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.

Recommended ages 13-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Guanacaste Day Tour to Arenal: Canyoning at Lost Canyon with Hot Springs and Dinner

Canyoneering is a brand-new sport that’s becoming very popular all over the world, especially in Costa Rica. The rugged, mountainous terrain near the Arenal Volcano is the perfect place for first-timers and experienced Canyoning enthusiasts to hike deep into the rainforest and rappel massive waterfalls – the largest waterfall is almost 200ft high!

We will pick you up from your Guanacaste hotel and drive about 2.5 hours to the Arenal Volcano area. From there you'll head to Desafio's Lost Canyon and get to rappel, hike, down-climb and river trace. After your tour, change your clothes and have a delicious homemade lunch. We are able to accommodate pretty much all dietary needs like gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, raw foods and more! You'll love our Warrior Buffet lunch!

Then, we will take you to one of our favorite hot springs locations to relax your muscles after your big workout! The hot springs are naturally heated by the Arenal Volcano and decked out with tropical gardens, waterfalls and swim-up bars to buy beer, wine or cocktails. After your dip, you'll be invited to change your clothes and have dinner at the restaurant on-site.

Afer a couple of hours soaking, we will pick you up and drive you back to your hotel in Guanacaste with one of our friendly drivers in our vans equipped with FREE WiFi so you can brag to your friends back home about the awesome day you had in Arenal!
