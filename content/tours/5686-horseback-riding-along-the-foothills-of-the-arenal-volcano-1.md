advice: "Please let us know your riding abilities and weight for this Arenal activity so we can get you properly fitted for your horse and saddle for this horseback ride in Arenal. Our horses are smaller framed quarter horses and can only support riders less than 250 pounds. Normally we take some time picking up clients and you get to the stable and get your helmet and safety talk. The ride itself is about 2 hours long.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Horseback Riding along the surroundings of the Arenal Volcano

Featuring the Arenal Volcano and its surrounding rainforest as the main natural scenery, at our horseback riding camp you can enjoy a key nature tour for your Costa Rican vacation, on very well tended horses. After horseback riding lessons or instruction as needed, you will be ready to ride the trails, including a rainforest portion where howler monkeys and birds can be seen. The tour also visits the Arenal Volcano scenic point, to appreciate the magnificence of the volcano and one of the beautiful lakes that it originated at its flanks.

All of our horses are lovingly cared for. Traditionally an important part of Hotel Los Lagos, they are all properly fed and watered. Also, they are alternated at work to ensure they get enough rest. Thus we can offer you a quality horseback riding experience, for you as well as for the horses!

The Los Lagos Hotel, Spa & Resort horseback riding tour goes through the hotel’s hacienda and rainforest and then along the path that goes to Los Juncos Lake and passes on to the observatory where, on a clear day, you can appreciate the great view of the Arenal Volcano. Then we continue through one mile of primary tropical rainforest to Los Lirios Lake, giving you the chance for great bird watching and occasional wildlife sightings before riding back to the first lake.

At Los Juncos, we stay for a while in the Arenal Volcano scenic point. You can see volcanic material descending from the conic crater and feel the power and beauty of the scenery formed simultaneously by the Arenal Volcano, this lake and the tropical rainforest.

The guide conducting the ride carries a first-aid kit at all times, and motorized assistance is available by radio communication.

This is a guided tour, approximately 8 kilometers long, which takes you into a 500-hectare property and lasts between an hour and a half and two hours.

We gauge the excursion to take about 2.5 hours including hotel pick up and drop-off, the safety talk, getting geared up with your helmet, getting settled in your saddle and having a drink at the look-out point. After an intense and active tour day you can relax in the hotel’s hot springs (entrance only), shuttles back to your hotel can be provided after spending time at the hotsprings.

This is one of our favorite Arenal, Costa Rica adventure tours!
