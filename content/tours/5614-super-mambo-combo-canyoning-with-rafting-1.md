advice: "We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOS, you may have a short break at office to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) itâ€™s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

NEW! Super Mambo Combo: Canyoning in the Lost Canyon and Costa Rica Whitewater Rafting Sarapiqui River class 3

Maximize your vacation experience with a COMBO of two of our most popular adventure tours near the Arenal Volcano: Canyoning in the Lost Canyon and Sarapiqui Whitewater Rafting class 3. Get wet as you rappel down waterfalls and explore a pristine jungle canyon deep in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, then keep the adrenaline flowing as you tackle the rapids of one of Arenal's most exciting rivers! Prepare yourself for a day full of laughter and adventure on our NEW Arenal adventure tour: SUPER Mambo Combo!

Get an early start at the canyon house, our Base Camp of the Lost Canyon where you'll receive safety gear and instructions from our experienced, bilingual guides. Then, get right down to business with the first rappel -- this one's a nice and easy 10ft rappel to help you shake off the nerves and get your canyon-legs! You'll continue exploring the canyon while getting a full-body workout at the same time. Rappel down some more watefalls, let go and fly through the air, and climb and slide your way through this lost canyon. By the end of the experience, you'll have worked up an appetite for delicious Costa Rican food and even more adventure!

After a brief recharging of batteries, you'll start the next leg of your adventure at the rafting put-in at the Sarapiqui River. Once again, our professional and bilingual rafting guides will make sure you have everything you need for your Costa Rica whitewater rafting adventure. You'll get your paddles, helmet, and life jacket as well as some quick but thorough safety instructions (safety always comes first!). Then, you'll hit the river, ready to tackle some of the most excting class 3 rapids Costa Rica has to offer!

When your wild ride on the river comes to an end, you'll have a chance to wind down, dry off, change your clothes, and check out the awesome pictures from the river (available for purchase after the tour) while you await your delicious Costa Rican meal at our private restaurant right on the Sarapiqui River called The Red Eyed Frog. Once you've finished eating, we'll take you back to your hotel. Be sure to to upload your photos to FaceBook and Instagram so all of your friends and family can see just how much fun you are having in Costa Rica.
