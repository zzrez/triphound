Monteverde Extremo Park Canopy Zipline

The name of the park says it all: this ziplining tour is one of the most EXTREME zipline canopy tours in Monteverde. Work your way across cables of increasing length until you get to The Big One: a cable measuring 1 kilometer (3281 ft)! Fly over the cloud forest of Monteverde, then dip down and rocket through a tunnel carved below one of the area's many mountains. The only tour in Monteverde that allows you to zipline both above and below ground, this exhilerating canopy tour is a definite "must-do" while in Costa Rica!

The Monteverde Extremo Park Canopy Zipline Tour offers an unforgettable experience along with modern and safe equipment, a safety briefing and tour instructions, experienced guides, a waterfall view, and an exhilerating zipline tour along 14 cables -- five of which are extremely long, ranging from 425 meters to 1 kilometer (1394 to 3281 ft)!

To add to your experience of EXTREME adventure, this canopy tour also includes a 30 meter (98 ft) rappel, a free-fall Tarzan Swing, and two Superman-style cables, one of which sends you soaring beneath the earth through a 175 meter (574 ft) mountain tunnel.

With the lush green of Monteverde's rainforest canopy below you, experience the feeling of true freedom as you fly solo through the air. The exhileration of the flight -- and for some, the conquering of fears -- will leave you feeling like a new person. Don't go home without trying this tour -- you won't regret it.
