Beginner to Intermediate Riders - total elevation +918 ft

On this 13km or 26km ride (if you ride both ways) you will enjoy being surrounded by lush rain forest that is rich in a variety of flora and fauna. Along the ride there is often the opportunity to see howling monkeys, coatis, and birds like toucans, egrets and king fishers. This ride takes place on a gravel road, making it accessible to all levels of riders. The road connects the Arenal Volcano National Park to Lake Arenal, passing through the small town of El Castillo along the way to our destination. This is one of the towns that was affected by the 1968 eruption. Our guides will share more about the history of this area and the effects of the eruption along the ride. On route you will be able to cross various rivers which offer the perfect opportunity to cool down and admire the scenic beauty of this destination. Enjoy the beautiful views of the iconic Arenal Volcano (weather dependent) and a snack right on the shore of Lake Arenal, the largest man-made lake in Central America. After the snack you can make the choice to ride back or hop into our support vehicle.
