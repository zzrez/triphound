Our Signature Costa Rica Rainforest Tour combines our Rainforest Waterfall Tour with El Tour Del Campo – Have the best of it all!

Waterfalls, the delicious Paz del Campo Restaurant, Costa Rica rainforest and countryside are what await you on our signature half-day tour.

A short photo-opportunity and you’re under the canopy and off to Waterfall Pura Vida for a rejuvenating swim in its many pools.

We start our ascent in to the mountains of Agujitas and Carara National Park just behind the Jaco and Los Suenos area. On your way up the mountain you will pass by small falls, a teak farm and secondary rainforest.

Cresting atop a 2000ft mountain from sea-level you will delight in spectacular views of the Nicoya Peninsula laying over the Pacific Ocean, and framed by the Costa Rican countryside.

A short photo-opportunity and you’re under the canopy and off to Waterfall Pura Vida for a rejuvenating swim in its’ many pools. For the adventurous thrill-seekers, there are several jumping points around the pools.

Leaving one paradise for another, you will head to the beautiful and serene Paz del Campo Restaurant and Tilapia Farm (closed Tuesdays) passing through the quaint mountain pueblo of Bijagual.

Once there, you can lie back and soak up the serenity with a cold cerveza (not included), or try your hand at fishing the tilapia from the surrounding pond.

At Paz del Campo Don Gerardo and his staff will serve up a delicious authentic Costa Rican meal (included) for you to enjoy in his secluded mountain paradise.

Just another day in paradise!
