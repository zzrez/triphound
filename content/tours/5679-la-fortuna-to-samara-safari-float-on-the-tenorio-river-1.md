advice: "Your luggage stays in our vehicles and our driver stays with your items while you are doing your tour. We have private entrances and exits for our rafting tour locations. Extra transport charge for drop-off outside of our regular hotel zone.

If river conditions are unsuitable for the Río Tenorio, our head guide might make the call to change to a back-up river of a similar level and/or offer another tour – you're always guaranteed a fun, but safe day! You get a full refund if no tour is run."

Adventure Connection La Fortuna to Samara Safari Float on the Tenorio River

Turn your day of travel into an action packed adventure with the Safari Float Adventure Connection! This is the ultimate activity for nature lovers of all ages, especially children! It’s also perfect for couples or large groups who want to spend some quality time and relax together in the middle of a tropical paradise!

Your eagle-eyed guide will paddle and steer your raft as he points out many species of plants and animals that live in the jungle. Spot howler monkeys, lizards, crocodiles, and even river otters, plus an incredible amount of tropical birds such as ospreys, boat-billed herons, parrots, and kingfishers.

About half way down the river, you be able to see the river from land, as you pull over to the side and snack on some refreshing tropical fruit and icy cold spring water.

Then, make your way down the rest of the river where an open air-4x4 jeep will be waiting for you! Hop on board and ride on the bumpy back road through the scenic landscape until you reach a local restaurant where you’ll sit down to a delicious Costa Rican lunch!

From there we take you to the beach to enjoy the rest of your Costa Rica vacation.

What a perfect day of nature, adventure, and fun! An awesome tour in Costa Rica for Families! This is one of our favorite river trips in Costa Rica.
