We�ll bike across Arenal Dam and bike on the road along the north side of Arenal Lake. This road has very little traffic and offers the most relaxing ride through tropical forest, home of monkeys and birds. We enjoy great views of the lake as well as a chance to experience the rural life in this remote part of Costa Rica.

We�ll offer a picnic stop and lunch will be served at a restaurant at the end. We�ll return to our hotels surrounding the lake by car and enjoying imposing views of Arenal Volcano.

Distance: 28 km to 42 km / 17 to 26 miles.

Altitude gain: 970 m / 3180 ft.

Terrain: Rolling hills. Paved road with very little traffic, surounded by tropical forest.

Difficulty: Easy to Moderate.
