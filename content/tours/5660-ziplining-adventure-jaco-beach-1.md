Ziplining Adventure Jaco Beach

The Vista Los Sueños Canopy is a beautifully-designed ziplining activity where you'll enjoy exciting adventures and get up close and personal with nature near the Jaco Beach area.

This canopy zipline tour boasts spectacular views of the Herradura bay and Island, as well as the Nicoya Gulf. You will have the opportunity to view the Scarlet Macaws, Chestnut mandible Toucans and whiteface monkeys during your zipline tour way above the tree canopy.

Vista Los Sueños rests on 80 acres of land... and more than half of it is primary forest, where the Jaco ziplining tour is located.

The adventure starts with a 15-minute ride aboard our specially designed 25-passenger tractor. You will start to feel your adrenaline pumping as you make your way up the backroads to the first platform high up on a hill.

Once we arrive to the top of the mountain we then descend to the bottom via a series of zip lines, including 14 sturdy, well-designed, safe platforms and 12 fast cables.

There are a total of 3.5 kilometers of cables including the longest cable in the area of over 2,400 ft. long!

You will love this canopy ziplining tour near Jaco Beach.
