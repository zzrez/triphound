Sky Adventures Hanging Bridges unguided in Monteverde

You won’t want to miss this opportunity to see REAL Costa Rican nature! The hanging bridges tour is the most innovative way to hike through the rainforest as it takes you as close as you can get to the cloud forest canopy and the wildlife that lives high up in the trees! The trails are suspended high above the forest floor and stretch over a mile and a half long. All of the trails are generally very flat, making this the perfect tour for people of all ages and all endurance levels- children love this tour! On this unguided tour, you will be able to walk at your own pace and spend as much time taking photos and trying to spot birds and other wildlife on your own! What a wonderful way to get up-close and personal with Mother Nature!
