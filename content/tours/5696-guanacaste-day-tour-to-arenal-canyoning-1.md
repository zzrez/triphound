advice: "Extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone. Please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing. For Nosara or Punta Islita Beaches: extra charge $30. If you'd like to add hot springs and dinner to your One Day Tour to the Arenal Volcano at a slightly extra charge, please let us know.Have a look at ourAdventure Waiverif you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Guanacaste Day Tour: Arenal Canyoning & Free Time to Explore La Fortuna (Add hot springs and dinner at an extra charge.)

We'll pick you up from your hotel in Guanacaste and drive through the gorgeous Costa Rican backroads to the Arenal Volcano area. Then you will experience the ultimate waterfall adventure considered Trip Advisor's top experience in the world!

Upon arrival at the Lost Canyon Adventures Ops Center, you will be greeted by your guides who will suit you up with helmets and harnesses and then give you the 101 on canyoneering, complete with safety instructions, demonstrations, and lots of laughs!

Start off the rappelling-leg of your adventure with the first waterfall referred to as the “Baby" - a small-sized waterfall that allows you to practice and ease your way into learning the ropes - literally! Then hike deep into the rocky terrain of the wet and wild rainforest, surrounded by huge rocks, trees, and flowing streams. You’ll soon reach the “Big Boy” - the second largest waterfall. Imagine this: there you are, on a sturdy platform looking down into the depths of a massive 150-ft tropical waterfall. You’ll start off by rappelling down the rock face and about half way through you’ll hear “LET GO!” – a few moments later you’ll have experienced your first guided, adrenaline pumping free fall! This is when you will realize that this really is an experience of a lifetime!

Canyoneering is more than just rappelling; it’s a full body work out! Use your arms, legs, and hands to climb through Mother Nature’s obstacle course: You’ll be jumping into pools, sliding down a natural water slide, sitting under waterfalls, pulling yourself up some rocks and helping yourself down others. As you make your way through the four rappels, you’ll notice your strength and confidence keeps getting stronger and stronger… good thing, because the waterfalls keep getting bigger and BIGGER.

You will finish your adventure with a 200 ft waterfall drop -- rappelling part of the way and then letting go of the reins to experience another guided free fall drop! Talk about adrenaline!

As we hike back up the rainforest canyon, you’ll be invited to take your time and enjoy the serenity of the rain forest. It normally takes about 10 minutes, but many people take longer, stopping every so often to soak in this unique experience. At the top, change into your dry clothes and head up to the Canyon Café where there will be a well-deserved homemade lunch waiting for you that we like to call the WARRIOR BUFFET!

After this journey, you'll head to the popular town of La Fortuna and have a change to explore. There are many cute cafes, restaurants, souvenir stores, art galleries, as well as a charming central park, beautiful gardens and a central catholic church.

When you're ready, hop into our FREE WiFi-equipped Desafio vans and head back to Guanacaste! This is one of the best things to do and well-worth the trip to see another amazing part of Costa Rica whether you are staying in Tamarindo or another part of Costa Rica!
