advice: "This is a very rustic, up and com,ing part of Costa Rica. Not all tours and services run during the low season, so be sure to check with us first before making plans to visit here. This is one of our favorite things to do in Domincal Costa Rica!

Please let us know if you would prefer to do the horseback riding. We will have to check availability and will needto know your riding ability and size. Our horses are smaller-stature work horses and we do not allow passengers over 190lbs to ride. Thank you for understanding."

Hiking to the Nauyaca Waterfalls

Hiking to the Nauyaca Waterfalls is a fantastic way to explore the surrounding areas of Domincal. This is the quintessential Costa Rica waterfall you must visit. It will fill your soul with harmony as you soak in the fresh, cool rushing waters ofthis natural wonder.

We offer a a walk or hike up through a mountain trail to reach these spectacular Costa Rica waterfalls. Youwill be taken by a 4x4 pick up truck to a section of the trail and then hike in. The hike is 12 kilometers long in total (6 km in and 6 km out.)

Take you time to swim at the base of the waterall and cool off. A great way to spend the day close to Domincal Beach and get in touch with nature.

This walk is only recommended for people in a very good physical shape as the terrain is steep and rugged with some muddy sections. In addition, the climate is often hot and humid. This hike is not recommended for children or older people.

It is recommended to bring your own food, wear sunscreen, bathing suit and good, secure walking shoes.
