Sky Adventures Hanging Bridges with Guide in Monteverde

You won’t want to miss this opportunity to see the REAL Costa Rican nature! The hanging bridges tour is the most innovative way to hike through the cloud forest as it takes you as close as you can get to the cloud forest canopy and the wildlife that lives high up in the trees! You will learn about the nature and culture of Costa Rica as your naturalist guide points out different species of plants, birds and other wildlife that is abundant there. The trails are suspended high above the forest floor and stretch over a mile and a half long. All of the trails are generally very flat, making this the perfect tour for people of all ages and all endurance levels- children love this tour!
