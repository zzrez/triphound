advice: "Please let us know your riding abilities and weight so we can get you properly fitted for your horse and saddle for this Arenal Volcano Horseback ride. Please keep in mind that for Costa Rica horse riding, the special breed of Costa Rican Quarterhorses that are used for tourism are sturdy, hardworking animals, but tend to have smaller builds and cannot take riders over 200lbs.Normally we take some time picking up clients at their hotels and then you get to the stable and get your helmet and safety talk. The horseback ride near itself is about 2 hours long.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!Remember we are at the mercy of Mother Nature. There may be times when we have to modify a tour to provide the safest adventure for you. The waterfall may have a large water flow with unfavorable conditions to swim, but the walk down is still worth the visit!"

Horseback Ride to La Fortuna Waterfall and Indigenous Village

Horseback riding in Costa Rica is a favorite activity among travelers. On this horseback ride to the La Fortuna Waterfall and Replica Indigenous Village, you will see the spectacular Arenal Volcano and dormant Cerro Chato Volcano off in the distance with gorgeous green countryside all around. The horses are sturdy and friendly bred for tourism and are well adapted to the wet, jungle environment of Costa Rica.

This is a slow and easy ride up to the waterfall, so it is perfect for first-time riders, families, or people who really want to soak in the surrounding natural beauty. Throughout your 1-hour La Fortuna horseback ride through rainforest trails, your guide will point out wildlife, and you will get to see beautiful views of the green countryside and the breathtaking Arenal volcano.

When you reach the entrance to the waterfall, you will "park" your horse at a rustic ranch and head with your guide down to the La Fortuna Waterfall.

There are over 300 steps to get to the base of the La Fortuna Waterfall along a private trail. The last part of the hike down you will have to go over a few slippery rocks, but the trek is worth it! When you reach the bottom, you'll have an opportunity to take lots of pictures and swim in the cool waters of one of the largest waterfalls in Arenal.

This where you will get to relax and cool off in the river pools if conditions are suitable!

PLEASE NOTE: The walk down to the La Fortuna waterfall is not recommended for older people with hip, ankle or knee problems as the path is rather rocky and slippery. The Dos Pinos waterfall can be viewed from the upper platform where clients dismount their horses without having to do the hike down to the waterfall on the difficult path.

When you're ready, take your time as you head back up the trail and staircase to where your horses will be waiting to take you back to the ranch. This is an excellent, well-rounded horseback ride in La Fortuna.

On your way back, you’ll stop by a little thatched-roof cabin to learn about the Maleku, one of Costa Rica’s few remaining indigenous tribes that originates in the Arenal area. Admittedly it feels pretty touristic to make a stop at the Maleku site, but it's for a good cause. The Maleku economy relies on tourism and the sale of their original handmade artwork. The Maleku inhabited the La Fortuna Waterfall area and their populations peaked over 300-hundred years ago to several thousand members, but now fewer than 600 tribal members exist.

You will get to learn a little bit more about the Maleku culture and see the Maleku traditional handicrafts. You may even pick up a few words in Maleku like "kapi kapi!"

You might want to bring a little extra money to buy some authentic Costa Rican souvenirs! What a perfect way to see the beautiful nature and culture of Costa Rica!
