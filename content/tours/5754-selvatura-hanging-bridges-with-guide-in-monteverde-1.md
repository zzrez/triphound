Selvatura Hanging Bridges with Guide in Monteverde

Selvatura's Tree Top Hanging Bridges is one tour that you don't want to miss in Monteverde! See the Monteverde Cloud Forest from a bird's perspective while walking on the hanging bridges that are suspended from tree to tree. These bridges are some of the longest one in the country, providing almost 2 miles of walking and exploring. Each bridge is of varying lengths from 50 to 170 meters long and up to 60 meters high.

This is a great tour for everyone, especially children who are too young for ziplining and people who want to take their time to soak in the beautiful cloud forest. On this guided hike, your naturalist guide will tell you all you need to know about Monteverde, its nature, and its natural history. Your guide who has a keen eye for seeing hidden creatures, will point out wildlife and be able to name the different kinds of birds that fly by and the different kinds of interesting exotic plants that you will see. You will love it!
