bring: "*   Women: bathing suit, shorts and t-shirt preferably with sleeves to protect them from the sun.
*   Men: swim trunks and t-shirt.
*   Everyone has to wear shoes, the options are: strap sandals (Teva, Keen); water shoes or tennis shoes (NEVER flip flops or sandals without a back)."
advice: "*   Take sun block, a hat, glasses (optional):
    Apply sun block on arms, the front of legs and the back of the neck moderately.  Don not apply sun block on the back of legs because when in contact with water it will become very slippery and will increase the chances of falling out of the raft; nor on the forehead because when in contact with water it may drip onto eyes causing irritation.*   If wanted, you may bring a hat to wear under the helmet.
    *   If glasses are taken they must have a device to secure them, like a strap.
*   Waterproof camera, bottle of water (optional).
*   Please do not take jewelry or valuable objects, because they might get lost in the river."

This tour begins in the community known as Chilamate, where the facilities of Adventures of Sarapiquí are located, and it ends in Puerto Viejo of Sarapiquí. It is a very tranquil and safe area, great for observing nature, birds, the rain forest, and animals such as iguanas, monkeys and crocodiles.

Also, we offer you the option of doing the tour in a “fixed rowing boat”, in other words, we provide a guide who will do all the rowing for you so that you can sit back and use your telescope, binoculars, or your bird-watching book to enjoy the trip. Children as young as 4 may go on this trip with their parents and senior citizens as old as 90 may go as well. The complete tour covers a distance of approximately 11.5 kilometers (7.3 miles)..
