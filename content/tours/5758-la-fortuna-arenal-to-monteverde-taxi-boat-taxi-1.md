La Fortuna Arenal to Monteverde Van Boat Van -- also known as the Taxi Boat Taxi

Travel between Arenal and Monteverde with Desafio's Taxi Boat Taxi. This van boat van service is the fastest and a very scenic way to travel between the Arenal Vocano and the cloud forests of Monteverde. Plus, you get to have a fun and scenic boat ride on Lake Arenal and see gorgeous views of Volcano Arenal!

Monteverde is one of the most-unique villages in all of Costa Rica. It has a small-town, rural, country feel with a lot of cowboys walking around downtown Santa Elena, the main eco-touristic hot spot.

The blend of tourism and locals is fascinating. It's not unsual to eat at a local diner or "soda" and be sitting next to a local coffee farmer or horse guide.

Here is how the travel logistics look like for the Monteverde Taxi Boat Taxi boat transfer:

8:30am We leave the downtown La Fortuna area where our office is located and make our way up to Lake Arenal picking up clients along the way.

9:30am We arrive to the earthen dam of the Arenal Volcano and park the van. You can now remove your luggage from the van and make your way down the rocky, steep path to the boat. Remember, this is an adventurous way to travel in Costa Rica! You will board the boat and your captain will point out the lifejackets and safety instructions.

We will travel across the peaceful and picturesque Lake Arenal until we reach the other side to the small town of Rio Chiquito.

There is no permanent docking area because the Arenal Lake is a manmade reservoir for the hydroelectric project and docks are prohibited. This makes the deboarding process a little difficult because the path to the van for the next leg of your journey can be muddy or slippery. Your driver and captain will try to help as much as possible with your luggage.

Things may be a little confusing when you walk to where the vans are parked, so be sure to ask your boat captain for instructions on which van to board.

10:45am Start the last part of the transfer up the winding, steep gravel road to the Cloud Forests of Monteverde. You'll stop along the way to stretch your legs and have a snack and use the restrooms.

12pm Approximate Arrival to your hotel. You will likely pass thorugh the small town of Santa Elena located in the center of the Monteverde Cloud Forest region. Our office Monteverde Adventure Company is located about 100 meters down from the central shopping center, so please stop in to say "hello!"
