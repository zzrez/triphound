Costa Rica Kayak Fishing on Lake Arenal

Our Costa Rica fishing expedition on Lake Arenal can now be done in one of our specialized fishing kayaks. You will love this expedition-style fishing excursion, paddling along the peaceful and picturesque bays of Lake Arenal early in the morning. We tend to hug the shallower parts of the exposed islands and inlets for better fish-catching possibilities. As you cast your line along the quiet waters and whispering reeds, you'll probably be humbled by the views of the mammoth Arenal Volcano.

This is a great activity for hardcore fishing enthusiasts and also works great for couples and families. We bring along our Desaf√≠o Explorer boat as back-up so other family members can just hang out on the boat and enjoy the ride as you explore Lake Arenal together.

There are three main types of fish in Lake Arenal that we'll be fishing for: You will be delighted by the frisky nature of our Machaca fish (scientific name: Brycon behreaeon). This fish is best caught fly casting from your kayak or the shore. The Rainbow Bass (scientific name: Parachromis dovii) lurks in the tall brush areas of the lagoon and are known to have a strong fight like its cousin the Largemouth Bass. And the hardest to catch is the Bobo (scientific name: Joturus Pichardi) which, as we have experienced, have a good appetite for green, yellow and red lures that have good drag -- but they are definitely a hard catch!

They say the early bird catches the worm, but in the case of fishing on Lake Arenal, the early bird has a better chance at striking some fun fish close to dawn. Don't miss out on some excellent angling while in the Arenal Volcano area!

"Kayak Fishing on Lake Arenal is a Recommended Costa Rica Fishing Vacation option for Serious Anglers!"
