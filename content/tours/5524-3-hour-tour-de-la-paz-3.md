Exciting Terrain, spectacular views and an exhilarating trip to the Pura Vida waterfall combine for our crowd-pleasing, 3-Hour Tour de la Paz.

Experience 20 kilometers of rainforest and beach views with your own personal guide, and top the trip off with a quintessential Costa Rican experience; a fantastic trip to a gorgeous, mountain-side waterfall hidden within the tropical rainforest. The 3 Hour Tour de la Paz is where the real fun begins.

Exciting terrain, spectacular views and an amazing swim in a Costa Rica rainforest waterfall!

The Tour de la Paz begins in the mountains directly behind Jacó, and continues roughly half the distance to the peak of the mountain to a beautiful 35ft. waterfall (Cascada del Zorro) – a perfect spot to get a little wet and take some photos.

After the brief stop, we continue up through primary rainforest and above the canopy to the top of the mountain range.

Just beyond the crest of the mountain lies a beautiful mirador offering views of the ocean playing against sands as far south as Manuel Antonio, as far west as the Nicoya Peninsula, and as far north as the port city of Puntarenas.

Continuing along the mountain tops and through the rainforest, you arrive at the second, incredible waterfall of your tour with us - the exciting Pura Vida waterfall.

Surrounded by lush rainforest and crested by a natural rock platform, thrill-seeking adventurers may jump over 15 feet down into the crisp, refreshing waterfall pool below. The sounds of rushing water, coupled with the call of exotic birds combine to make this visit to the Pura Vida Falls a truly Costa Rican experience that you will remember for years to come.

To end the tour, we ride the loop that takes us right to the edge of the famous Carara National Park, and then begin our decent back to Adventure Tours in Jaco.
