advice: "We have created these fun Arenal COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.Please let us know your riding abilities and weight so we can get you properly fitted for your horse and saddle for the Arenal horseback riding part of the COMBO. Our horses are smaller framed quarter horses and can only support riders less than 200 pounds. Normally we take some time picking up clients and you get to the stable and get your helmet and safety talk. The ride itself is about 2 hours long.

Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!Remember we are at the mercy of Mother Nature. There may be times when we have to modify a tour to provide the safest adventure for you. The waterfall may have a large water flow with unfavorable conditions to swim, but the walk down is still worth the visit!"

Arenal COMBO Tour: Lost Canyon Canyoning & Horse Ride to La Fortuna Waterfall and Indigenous Village

Make the most of your limited vacation time by going on two exciting tours in one day! Visit the Lost Canyon, the best place to go canyoneering in Costa Rica and then horseback ride to the majestic La Fortuna Waterfall. This is the perfect combination of adventure, nature and serious fun!

Visit two of the most popular attractions in Arenal Costa Rica - the Lost Canyon for adventurous canyoneering and then finish off with a leisurely horseback ride to the breathtaking La Fortuna waterfall!

The Lost Canyon Adventures canyoning base camp is situated deep into the Costa Rican rainforest. To get to the Lost Canyon, we will take you on our exciting Jungle Limo 4x4 Landcruiser vehicles and ride through the rolling hills of the gorgeous Costa Rican countryside.

When you start your adventure, you’ll find out that canyoneering is more than just rapelling; it’s a full-body work out! You’ll use your arms, legs, and hands to climb through Mother Nature’s obstacle course - jumping into pools, sliding down a natural water slide, sitting under waterfalls, pulling yourself up some rocks and helping yourself down others in a downclimb.

Then, finish your Arenal canyoning adventure with a 200-ft waterfall drop -- you will do a little rappelling against the rock wall and waterfall, but then launch off in a guided-rappel the rest of the way and then letting go of your fears in a free fall drop! Talk about adrenaline!

You'll have to hike about 12 minutes back up the canyon to our Canyon Café and enjoy a delicious all-you-can-eat lunch we call the WARRIOR BUFFET before heading back down on the Jungle Limo and being dropped off at the horse ranch entrance for your La Fortuna horseback riding tour!

Upon arrival to the ranch, you will be introduced to your horse and guide who will provide safety instructions, provide you your helmet and tell you about the route you are about to take.

Along the way, your guide will point out wildlife, and you will get to see beautiful views of the green countryside and the breathtaking Arenal volcano. When you reach the entrance to the La Fortuna waterfall, you will "park" your horse and head with your guide down to the La Fortuna Waterfall. There are 300 pretty-treacherous steps to get to the famous La Fortuna Waterfall and 300 to get back up!

When you reach the bottom of the La Fortuna waterfall on this Arenal horseback ride, you'll have an opportunity to take lots of pictures and swim in the cool waters of one of the largest waterfalls in Costa Rica. When your ready, take your time as you head back up the staircase where your horses will be waiting to take you back to the ranch. On your way back, you’ll stop by a little thatched-roof cabin to learn about the Maleku, one of Costa Rica’s few remaining indigenous tribes that originated in the Arenal area. You will get to see their traditional handicrafts and learn about their culture and language. You might want to bring a little extra money to buy some authentic Costa Rican souvenirs! It feels a little touristy, but its for a very good cause. The Maleku rely on funds they receive for selling their artwork and giving their presentations, so sit back and listen tot he enchanting tails of the Maleku.
