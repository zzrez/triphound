advice: "This tour is considered an extreme adventure and one of the best things to do in Costa Rica and advisable for those who are athletic and physically fit. No experience necessary. There are different jump heights throughout the tour and paths in case you decide to skip a jump - but the idea is to push yourself to your limits on this Costa Rica extreme tour Gravity Falls! Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

If coming from San Jose, we can arrange this special Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping Costa Rica canyoning expedition as a Desafio Adventure Connection where your journey is the adventure! Be sure to ask one of our Adventure Specialists to help you with your reservations. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions! NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up"

Gravity Falls EXTREME COMBO: Waterfall Jumping, Mountain Biking and Rafting in One Day!

The Gravity Falls EXTREME COMBO is for the true adventurer who wants to step outside of the regular tour experience and have an exclusive full-on burst of adrenaline. During this tour, you will do the Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping Extreme tour, followed by a mountain bike ride through rural country roads to the Balsa River and then raft down one of Costa Rica’s famous class three rivers.

First Stop: Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping

Deep down in the Costa Rican jungle lies our newest and most extreme tour yet: The Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping canyoning tour. This tour starts off with a rappel along the edge of a thundering 140-ft waterfall. When you reach the bottom, you’ll have to jump into the deep pool and swim your way to shore. You’ll be faced with a series of cliff jumps ranging from a 10-ft technical jump to a 30-ft jump off another waterfall. Throughout the adventure, you will have opportunities to swim, river-float, down-climb, hike and maneuver your way through this isolated and exclusive canyon.

Next Stop: Mountain Biking

Once you’ve caught your breath from waterfall jumping, you’ll be suited up with mountain bikes and helmets at the finish point of Gravity Falls at our famous outdoor toilets and changing rooms. You'll then start your journey through rural dirt roads and small villages that you will encounter as you leave the Gravity Falls canyon. This mountain bike ride in Costa Rica has some nice downhill sections on open gravel roads in the beginning and then narrows into a flatter area with rolling hills and lush countryside.When you arrive at our private put-in at Río Balsa, you'll leave your bike with your adventure guide and meet your fun rafting guide.

Part Three – the Final Descent: White Water Rafting on the Balsa River

True to the Desafio name, you will CHALLENGE yourself as you paddle down 10 kilometers of exciting rapids. As you descend down this beautiful class 2-3 river, you’ll have a chance to admire the lush greenery, vines, and different types of insects, birds and animals — your eagle-eyed guides will even point out the monkeys, sloths and toucans along the way. About half way down the river your guides will provide you with a snack of fresh tropical fruit as you relax or go for a swim in the refreshing river pool.

When your rafting adventure is finished, you will get to change into your dry clothes and sit down for a relaxing delicious meal at an exclusive local hangout. Your photographer will show you photos of your rafting trip before dropping you back off at your La Fortuna hotel.
