advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. We have one of the most flexible cancellation policies in Costa Rica. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours.NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up

ZONE 1: 1-22 pax: No extra charge

ZONE 2: Lost Iguana, Observatory Lodge, Arenal Lodge & The Springs Resort: $20 per trip or $40 roundtrip. ZONE 3: Rancho Margot, Linda Vista, Arenal Vista: $25; $50 rndtrp

ZONE 4: Leaves & Lizards, V. Hermosa, Tilajari: $35/trip; $70 rndtrp"

Arenal COMBO Tour: Rafting on the Balsa River Class 2 and 3 then Hot Springs & Dinner

We try to make your vacation as easy and affordable as possible so we have combined two of the Arenal Volcano Costa Rica area's top two tour options: rafting the exuberant class 2-3 Rio Balsa with soaking in one of our beautiful hot springs attractions.

The town of La Fortuna is surrounded in deep rainforest with many adventure activities available. In addition, La Fortuna is considered the Hot Springs Capital of the World making it one of the best places in the world to do adventure tourism. We like to say: Live the Adventure -- Relax in Pure Nature!

That's why we know you will love this Arenal Rafting with Hot Springs and dinner COMBO.

After being picked up in our air-conditioned vans equipped with WiFi, you'll arrive at the Balsa River at our private put-in that is eqipped with restrooms and changing rooms for your convenience. Your experienced bilingual guides will give you a safety talk with paddling instructions, NRS life jackets, and Pro-Tec helmets.

Then you're off to challenge yourself as you paddle through fun & safe rolling rapids with names like "Congo Loco" & "Rock around the Croc" and the very technical and challenging “Las Dragas” section. Play around in tranquil river pools in an isolated rainforest river canyon while taking in all the wildlife around you! You’ll be on the water for about 2 to 2.5 hours, paddling along 10 kilometers of lush Costa Rican rainforest.

Hopefully you'll get to see lots of wildlife like monkeys, sloths, and tropical birds such as Ospreys, Oropendolas and Toucans. The Río Balsa is dam-controlled, so we are guaranteed good water levels all-year long! Half way through you'll break for a snack of tropical fruit and then afterwards you will be treated to a delicious home-cooked meal! When you are ready, we'll take you to the hotsprings where you can relax your mind and body before heading to the restaurant for dinner. This is an ideal day trip for couples, families or groups of friends!
