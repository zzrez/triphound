One of the most unique ways to experience a Costa Rican sunset is from the surrounding rainforest that climbs thousands of feet above her shores.

Our cruise through secondary rainforest gets you to the most photogenic Costa Rican sunsets in the Jaco and Los Suenos area. Your English-speaking guide will be happy to point out any wildlife that should cross your path, as well as other points of interest along the way.

Bring your camera, and if you like, your own beverages to enjoy this unique experience.

You will have a great chance to see Costa Rican wildlife that only appears around the close of day.

Bring your camera, and if you like, your own beverages to enjoy this unique experience. Enjoy the show from the mountains surrounding Jaco and Los Suenos as the sun falls delicately across the Bay of Nicoya, over the Pacific Ocean and Nicoya Peninsula.

The perfect end to another day in paradise.
