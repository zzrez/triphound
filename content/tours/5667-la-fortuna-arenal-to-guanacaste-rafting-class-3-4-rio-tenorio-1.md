DESAFIO ADVENTURE CONNECTION: Arenal to Guanacaste Rafting Tenorio River Class 3 and 4

Save money and save time! Get your adrenaline pumping on this exciting class 3-4 rafting adventure on the way to your next vacation destination! Witness the exotic flora and fauna as you travel of this beautiful, raging river as you travel from Arenal to, descend the Tenorio River and then continue on to your destination at the beach!

Costa Rica is well-known as the whitewater rafting capital of the world due to its abundant raging rivers and thriving adventure attitude! You won't want to miss out on this quintessential Costa Rican activity while you're at the beach! Go rafting rain or shine -- you're going to get wet anyway! And this is the perfect way to make the journey your adventure with a transfer + tour as you travel from Arenal to Guanacaste.

Don't miss out on the perfect adventure for a La Fortuna to Guanacaste transport.

The Tenorio River is a beautiful river that winds its way through the Guanacaste mountain range along a deep, red-rock canyon surrounded by magnificent landscapes of low, tropical and dry forest.

We'll pick you up from your hotel in the Arenal Costa Rica area and drive about 2.5 hours along the picrturesque Lake Arenal, across the rustic Costa Rican back roads, through gorgeous mountains and quaint villages until we reach the Tenorio Operations Center on the PanAmerican Highway.

You'll then take a scenic 4x4 ride for about 45 minutes to the Tenorio River put-in at the bridge over the Tenorio River. There your guide will give you the 101 on rafting including safety tips and technical instructions. You’ll receive a thorough safety briefing and get fitted for your equipment -- helmets, lifejackets and paddles. A quick practice with your guide and you are then ready to start heading on your 2.5-hour journey down one of Costa Rica’s most famous rivers!

You’ll be engulfed in the impressive Tenorio River canyon with many different types of flora and fauna - there is lush greenery, vines, birds, monkeys and other types of wildlife.

You’ll experience over 20 thrilling rapids, and finish the tour off with Costa Rica's MOST extreme whitewater river rapid -- it is an incredible 12-ft waterfall drop that we have aptly named: "Cascabel Falls!" -- this is an amazing way to finish this tour!

When you arrive to the end of your exciting rafting journey at our private river exit, do a quick hike to the 4x4 vehicle to drive out of this isolated, unspoiled region of Costa Rica.

You’ll then be treated to a delicious, homemade lunch at our Tenorio Outpost private restaurant where you can use our changing rooms and then head on your way to your hotel in time for a glorious, Pacific sunset.

This tour also departs from Monteverde or Arenal on our Adventure Connection and meets up with the rafters coming from Guanacaste and Nicoya beach areas for the 10:00am tour.

Recommended for ages 13-65 in good physical condition. Private trips available. A photographer will be on each tour so you can purchase photos of your rafting adventure.
