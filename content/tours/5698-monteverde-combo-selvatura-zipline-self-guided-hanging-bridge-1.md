advice: "For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) itâ€™s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Monteverde COMBO Tour: Selvatura Ziplines & Self-guided Hanging Bridges

The Selvatura Park in Monteverde is an amazing place because it is situated right in the Monteverde Cloud Forest and offers fun and adrenaline-pumping activities above the trees. You will get to stroll along the hanging bridges that are up to 500 feet high, taking your time to birdwatch and see other interesting plants and wildlife. You'll experience the natural wonder of Costa Rica and the wildlife that lives there. Then, head on an adventure ziplining above the tree tops on a series of 15 adrenline pumping cables and then finish off with a heart-pumping "Tarzan Swing."
