Cooking and Salsa Dance Lesson Combo

Learn to cook and dance like a local in this unique night out in La Fortuna! The perfect way to get to know Costa Rican culture and take part in some of our most important activities in Costa Rica: cooking, eating and dancing!

People are starting to really take to learning about new cultures and the best way to do that is to learn about what the locals eat.

Turns out, Costa Rica has amazing cuisine -- it's healthy, natural and actually very easy to learn how to cook it. That's why you'll be wanting to take back local spices and try some of our favorite recipes back homw with your friends and families.

We've planned these cooking classes as a great way to get to know other travelers and hang out with a knowledgable local "chef!"

But the night gets even better because as soon as you finish cooking, you'll be able to sit down to the delicious meal you helped cook up and chat about the "Pura Vida" of Costa Rica.

But wait... there's more! Hope you brought your dancing shoes to Costa Rica, because we then head to the dance floor to learn how to dance to some of our favorite latin beats -- salsa, merengue, cumbia y bachata!

There is no batter way to spend an evening in La Fortuna than cooking, eating and dancing like a local with us!
