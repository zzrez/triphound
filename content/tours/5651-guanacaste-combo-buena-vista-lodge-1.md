Guanacaste Combo: Buena Vista Lodge Ziplines, Lunch, Horseback Riding, Waterslide, Hot Springs & Mud Baths

Get ready for a day filled with fun and adventure! This is the perfect combo tour for families and couples. Start the day off with a zipline canopy tour through the lush Costa Rican rainforest. You’ll zip across 10 zipline cables, admiring the natural beauty of Costa Rica while getting a chance to see different types of vegetation, birds, and monkeys. These zipline cables are all a variety of lengths and heights, the highest being 60 meters high and the longest if 120 meters long!

Then, change into your bathing suit for some wild water fun! Keep that adrenaline pumping as you slide down a 400-meter water slide. The refreshing water will cool you off before you head to the restaurant for lunch. Relax in the restaurant and enjoy a delicious lunch buffet of fresh natural foods- you’ll get a taste of the traditional foods of Costa Rica.

After lunch, you’ll meet your horses and take a 40-minute hike through gorgeous Costa Rican scenery until you reach the luxurious hot springs. Pamper yourself as you enter 5 pools of different sizes and temperatures.

The steam room and the mud bath are some favorite features of the hot springs! Cover your body in mud, let it dry, and then wash it off in the shower. Kids love how fun this is and you’ll love how soft and rejuvenated your skin feels afterwards. When you’re ready, change into your dry clothes, hop back on your horses and ride back to the main lodge. This is where your van will be waiting to take you back to your hotel with many memories to share with your friends back home!
