advice: "Our exclusive, PRIVATE trips include private transport to and from your hotel, you get our most-experienced, top bilingual guides to accompany you, personalized choice of food options, no sense of rushing along - you can take your time, plus you get your photos included. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don\`t miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Private Rafting on the Sarapiqui Class 3 and 4 -- take a Private Tour

Bring on the adrenaline and enjoy the “Jungle Run” on the Sarapiqui River. This is the perfect rafting trip for adventurous paddlers! We'll pick you up at your hotel and travel through small Costa Rican villages to the quaint town of San Miguel de Sarapiquí. There, your professional rafting guide will give you the 101 on rafting including safety tips and technical instructions before heading on your 2 hour journey down one of Costa Rica’s most exuberant rivers! During your decent down the river, you will experience over 30 exciting rapids along 10 km of lush, vibrant rainforest.

As you make your way through exciting rapids like “The Pipeline,” “The Terminator,” and “Dos Locos”, we’ll be sure to get your adrenaline pumping! About half way down the river, you’ll stop and watch the rapids from the shore, while enjoying refreshing tropical fruit and relaxing with the rest of the group. Then, after the second leg of your rafting journey, you’ll finish the day with an unforgettable homemade lunch before heading to your next vacation destination!
