advice: "We provide a delicious, homemade meal at the end of the Lost Canyon Adventures canyoning tour we call the WARRIOR BUFFET - please let us know should you have any dietary restrictions like vegetarian needs, gluten-free, kosher, etc. and we will do our best to accommodate you! Combine the Lost Canyon with rafting to do our unique MAMBO COMBO Rappel & Raft tour -- only with Desafio near the Arenal Volcano! You can also purchase handy dry bags from the Desafio EGO Store if you'd like to take a camera with you. Just ask at our reception desk.

Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours. NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone."

Lost Canyon Adventures Canyoning -- Costa Rica's best multi-sport adventure near the Arenal Volcano!

We get many requests from visitors who want to experience the REAL Costa Rica -- and that's what the Lost Canyon is all about! You'll rappel down huge waterfalls, jump into pools, zip down guided rappels, downclimb the canyon walls and river boulders, and hike up through the rainforest. We pack all kinds of adventure into the best canyoning experience in Costa Rica!

Door-to-door service: We provide door-to-door service and pick you up at your hotel.

Lost Canyon Ops Center: After a fun, 15-minute ride in your Jungle Limo, you'll arrive at the Lost Canyon Ops Center. Is canyoning safe in Costa Rica? Your professional Desafio adventure guides will fit you with high-quality canyoneering gear and give you a safety talk and canyoning demonstration before beginning your adventure.

Baby steps: Start off the rappelling-leg of your canyoning journey with the first waterfall referred to as the "Baby," a small-sized 10-ft waterfall that allows you to ease your way into learning the ropes -- literally!

Just LET GO!: You’ll soon reach what we fondly call the “Big Boy," the second largest waterfall. About half-way through your rappel, you’ll hear the call to “LET GO!” – a few moments later you’ll experience your first guided, adrenaline-pumping canyon free fall! Heart racing and eyes sparkling, you'll continue your journey through the canyon as you build up to the largest Lost Canyon challenge: an exciting 200ft waterfall rappel.

Warrior Buffet: When you finish your tour, settle in for your best meal in Costa Rica at our famous WARRIOR BUFFET full of delicious, home-cooked food.
