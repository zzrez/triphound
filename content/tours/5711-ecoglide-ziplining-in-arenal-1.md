advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 4-85. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) itâ€™s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours.NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up

ZONE 1: 1-22 pax: No extra charge

ZONE 2: Lost Iguana, Observatory Lodge, Arenal Lodge & The Springs Resort: $20 per trip or $40 roundtrip. ZONE 3: Rancho Margot, Linda Vista, Arenal Vista: $25; $50 rndtrp

ZONE 4: Leaves & Lizards, V. Hermosa, Tilajari: $35/trip; $70 rndtrp"

Ecoglide Ziplining in Arenal

You'll feel just like a bird as you fly above the tree tops of the rainforest near the Arenal Volcano. This canopy zipline tour is a perfect combination of adventure, nature and adrenaline right at the base of the impressive Arenal Volcano.

We like to work with Ecoglide Canopy Zipline because they provide small group experiences, incorporate a second security cable and have multiple start times.

You'll be geared up at the Ecoglide operations center with all the equipment you need to enjoy a safe and fun adventure and receive a safety speech to learn more about what you'll be doing during the tour. From there, you'll head to the first canopy platform in an off road vehicle, and after that, you'll take off flying!

The ziplining platforms at Ecoglide are surrounded by primary rainforest and great 365-degree views! EcoGlide offers the highest standards of security for ziplining -- one of the coolest adventure sports ever!

This canopy zipline adventure will take you on a total of 13 exciting cables throughout this well-thought-out adventure park. The first cable is only 25 meters long, intended to help you feel comfortable with your gear and get you ready to enjoy the rest of the cables of this adventure sport. The thrill of the zip increases from cable to cable until you arrive to cable number 12. This is the longest cable and is an exciting 430 meters long -- that's over 1,200 feet long!

Along the way, you'll have the opportunity to do a unique and exciting Tarzan Swing! You'll love this part of the tour!

The EcoGlide canopy zipline guides go out of their way to show you different species of animals and plants -- keep an eye out for deer, monkeys, snakes, sloths, frogs, peccaries, raccoons and a huge variety of birds -- these are just some of the animals that often appear during the tour as you enjoy a 360-panoramic view of the rainforest.

Ziplining in Costa Rica with EcoGlide is fun for the whole family!
