Offering sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, Jaco Beach and the Nicoya Peninsula, the 2-Hour ATV Tour de Gloria is our shortest tour, but it is still big on fun for the whole family.

The 2-Hour Tour de la Gloria is great for groups on a limited time frame.

Experience 30 kilometers of rainforest and beach views with your own personal guide.

Sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, Jaco Beach and the Nicoya Peninsula.

The Tour of La Gloria begins just one kilometer from our headquarters in Jaco where we access the trail that ascends in to the rainforest, and to our first stop on the tour.

Our first stop offers sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, Jacó Beach and the Nicoya Peninsula.

After the photo opportunity, we continue another few kilometers along the tops of the mountains of Agujitas and above the canopy before arriving at one of our favorite hidden mountain restaurants - Rancho Shadday - where their moniker is - A Place Where There is No World Crisis.

After a quick coffee or beverage, we begin to make our way back down the lush mountains through secondary rainforest.

For the final touch, we stop off at a small waterfall that runs through the path on our way back to Jaco headquarters.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON TRAIL CONDITIONS:
