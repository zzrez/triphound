advice: "We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

San Jose to Arenal Volcano Day Tour: Zipline, Lunch, Hot Springs & Dinner

We’ll pick you up from your hotel in San Jose in our air-conditioned vans with FREE WiFi and drive about three hours through the rolling hills and gorgeous landscape of Costa Rica’s interior. You will start off with your first activity: ziplining through the lush rainforest. You will definitely get your adrenaline pumping and be able to witness gorgeous views of the remarkable Arenal Volcano. Your experienced guide will point out the different species of birds that are regularly seen in the rainforest canopy. If you are lucky, you’ll get shots of the gorgeous and iconic toucan!

When you've finished zipling, we'll take you over to the hot springs where you'll be able to relax and reminisce about your day, enjoy a glass of wine at the swim-up bar, or relax and enjoy a delicious lunch. When you're done soaking, we’ll make our way back to San Jose. We'll stop for dinner on the way and you'll arrive at your hotel at around 10:00pm. It's a long day, but you'll thoroughly enjoy your time on this San José One-Day Tour.
