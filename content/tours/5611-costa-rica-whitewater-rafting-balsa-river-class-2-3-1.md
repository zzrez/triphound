advice: "See our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Rafting in Costa RicaHave a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.We sell dry bags and Chum sunglass holders, river shoes, and commemorative souvenir Rio Balsa t-shirts at our office and in our EGO Store in case you need any last-minute supplies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure appeal or offer other tour options. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions and will only run a tour according to our company policies. We have the most flexible cancellation policy in the industry: full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. Adventure tours involve some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition to attempt them. As the pioneering rafting company in Costa Rica's wet & wild Northern Zone, we only have 2 rules: 1) Be Safe! and 2) Have Serious Fun! NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone."
