Adventure Tours Costa Rica invites you on a spectacular half-day adventure aboard our fleet of exotic, Polynesian-style outrigger canoes as we tour the peaceful Pacific Ocean surrounding Playa Agujas.

Canoe past some of the most serene tropical beaches, stunning cliffs and immaculate scenery our country has to offer as your friendly, bilingual steersperson points out the area’s most beloved landmarks.

Since outrigger canoes are more efficient and easier to paddle than a typical kayak, you will be freer to take in the unspoiled nature that surrounds you as you spot a variety of aquatic birds, ranging from frigatebirds to pelicans. When conditions permit, your group may also enjoy snorkeling, beachcombing and monkey or bird watching as a part of your day’s adventure.

No experience is required to enjoy this tour to its fullest, and it is perfect for larger groups, corporate outings, groups of friends and families with grandparents and younger children. The outrigger canoe tour can accommodate groups as small as 4 and as large as 40.
