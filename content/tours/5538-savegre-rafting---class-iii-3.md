Why not spend a full day enjoying outdoor adventure travel with some whitewater rafting? Both challenging and family-friendly, a ride down the Savegre River is perfect for novices, experienced rafters and everyone in between.

The journey starts with a drive deep into Costa Rica's unspoiled countryside. Enjoy the scenery as you pass rolling green hills and wide-open valleys that meet majestic jungle-covered mountains. If you’d like to enjoy an authentic típico breakfast before the river run, you can disembark among quaint thatch-roofed dwellings in the hillside village of El Silencio.

After some instruction from a seasoned guide, you paddle off. Fed by natural springs and rushing streams in the Central Highlands, the clear waters of the Savegre flow to the Pacific with ever-changing conditions. You’ll glide through calm waters and get the first test of your rafting skills as you maneuver Class II whitewater. Soon you’ll rollick in adrenaline-pumping rapids as you take on the Class III stretches of "Malibu" "Cinderella" and the famed "Devil’s Mouth." Finally, ease out into a coastal estuary teeming with brightly colored tropical birds.

Of course, you’ll have plenty of chances to view Costa Rica’s unique wildlife along the way. While paddling in gentler waters you can gaze to the shores to see an array of tropical birds such as scarlet macaws, tiger herons, ospreys and the quetzal with its iconic colorful tail. On the shores, you’re apt to see monkeys swinging through the trees, while tapirs and jaguars stroll green grounds.

The landscape is as stunning as the wildlife. Your trip takes you through a seemingly endless expanse of lush primary forest. Mist-shrouded mountains with fresh-water cascades give way to sprawling palm plantations. Float past soaring rock formations, deep ravines and steep canyons. Stop to refresh in a spectacular waterfall and swim in a cool natural pool.

Dress: Wear quick-dry clothing such as swimwear or moisture-wicking performance wear. While tennis shoes are fine, rubber sports sandals with back straps are more advisable. Flip-flops will not serve you well.

Carry: You’ll be glad you brought a waterproof camera — best if it's a Go Pro. Strong sunscreen is a must. While the trip is not as buggy as land exploration, insect repellant is a plus. And you’ll appreciate a towel and a change of clothing for after your river ride.

But the number-one thing you will want to bring is the spirit of adventure. You desire to embark on a bold excursion during your visit to Costa Rica and there’s almost no bolder way than with a wild ride on a river raft.
