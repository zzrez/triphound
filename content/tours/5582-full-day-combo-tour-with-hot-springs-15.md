Hanging Bridges � La Fortuna Waterfall � Volcano Hike � Hot Springs

This Full Day tour starts at the Arenal Suspension Bridges, a private rain forest preserve with 250 hectares of protected land, with three kilometers of walking trails passing 15 bridges, six of them are hanging bridges, where you will see the forest from the ground. You�ll then head to La Fortuna Waterfall. A short hike down a steep trail (with steps and a handrail) takes you only a few feet in front of this powerful Río Fortuna waterfall. A typical lunch at a local restaurant is included.

After lunch you will take a guided walk along the trails of past lava flows at the Arenal Volcano National Park where we can hear eruptions and lava tumbling down the face of this mighty volcano.

A soothing soak in one of the naturally heated thermal springs at Arenal Volcano is something you definitely shouldn�t miss on your trip to Costa Rica, this will be the end of our lovely journey.
