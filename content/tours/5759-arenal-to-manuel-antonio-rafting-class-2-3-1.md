advice: "Your luggage stays in our vehicles and our driver stays with your items while you are doing your tour. We have private entrances and exits for our rafting tour locations. Extra transport charge for drop-off outside of our regular hotel zone.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good conditions!!"

DESAFIO ADVENTURE CONNECTION: Arenal to Manuel Antonio Rafting Class 2-3

Turn your day of travel into an action packed adventure! Rafting on the Balsa river is perfect for all nature lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, and people who are looking for an easy-going adventure to break up the ride to the beach!

We will pick you up from your hotel, so make sure you have your bags packed and have checked out of your hotel and that you are ready for adventure!

It's a good idea to be dressed for rafting with quick-dry clothing, secure shoes, a change of clothes and a snack you can bring in your day pack that stays in the van with the rest of your luggage.

After getting picked up from your hotel, we’ll drive through the beautiful Costa Rican back roads to our private put-in at the Balsa River, equipped with bathrooms and changing rooms for your convenience. Your driver will stay with the van at our private Balsa Boat House rafting center while you are on the river.

Once you've arrived at the Rio Balsa, your professional guide will start the day off by providing paddling and safety instructions and then suiting you up with safety gear to prepare you for your adventure!

You'll receive a top quality NRS helmet, life jacket and paddle.

Since the name of our company means "challenge," you'll definitely challenge yourself as you then paddle down over 10 kilometers of exciting rapids with names like “Congo Loco” and “Rock around the Croc!” Desafio rafts the longest stretch of rapids on the Rio Balsa.

As you descend down the river, you’ll have a chance to admire the lush greenery, vines, and different types of insects, birds and animals, like monkeys and sloths!

Half way down the Balsa River, you’ll have a chance to see the river rapids from the shore, while enjoying fresh tropical fruit and relaxing with the rest of your group!

You'll finish off the rest of the rafting trip with flatter water which gives you the opportunity to appreciate the exuberant wilderness that surrounds you.

When your rafting adventure is finished, you will meet your van at our private take-out changing rooms.

From there, you'll head out to enjoy a delicious typical Costa Rican lunch before heading to the picturesque beach of Manuel Antonio.

It's quite a ride the rest of the way to the beach and the first part has some twisty, curvy roads, so many clients request to have the lunch a little further along the way.

So, sit back and enjoy the ride on our Desafio Adventure Connection to Manuel Antonio.

Please note we have other Adventure Connection options from Arenal to Manuel Antonio.
