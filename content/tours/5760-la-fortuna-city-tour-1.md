La Fortuna City Tour - Tarde de Cafe

We have created a super fun and creative way to get to know one of the most-dynamic little towns in Costa Rica. this first of its kind La Fortuna City Tour starts out near the base of the Arenal Volcano and you get to explore our favorite places. Join us for what we call the Tarde de Cafe - La Fortuna City Tour - Tico-Style!

We will take you around to a couple of places we like to hang out around town and learn about the interesting history of the town of La Fortuna and the Arenal Volcano.

Stop off for some amazing coffee and then visit a local fruit and vegetable shop because the next part of your adventure is to buy a few of the ingredients for a classic Costa Rican Casado! You might have to brush up on your Spanish-speaking skills.

From there, we'll head on out to La Fortuna's iconic El Salto Waterfall Park. You can take a refreshing dip in the swimming hole if you'd like alongside the local La Fortuna youth who hang out there or just take in the beauty of the the fresh flowing waters of the Fortuna River.

You'll arrive just in time to start cooking up a delicious Costa Rican meal at Desafio's exclusive Hunters & Gatherers riverside restaurant. This is an interactive Costa Rica cooking class where you'll learn all of the hands on methods local Costa Ricans use to create the well-rounded and delicious Costa Rican Casado. The Casado is made up of the ubiquitous rice and beans, salad, mixed vegetable saute "picadillo" and a beef or chicken. These meals are easily customizeable in case your are a vegetarian, lactose intolerant, vegan or gluten free.

We hope you you will make new friends on this hands-on and unique La Fortuna experience and get to know authentic Costa Rica and end up learning to Cook Like a Local!
