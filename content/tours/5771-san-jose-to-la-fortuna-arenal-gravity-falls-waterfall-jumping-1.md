advice: "For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you should be in good physical condition."

San Jose to La Fortuna Arenal Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping

This is one of our top Adventure Connectons!

We'll pick you up from your hotel in San Jose and drive through the Costa Rican hills about 2 hours until we reach the entrance of Costa Rica's Most EXTREME Tour.

There, you will meet your guides and get suited up with your adventure gear and then head out on your adventure.

The tour starts off with a rappel along the edge of a thundering 140-ft waterfall. When you reach the bottom you’ll have to jump into the deep pool and swim your way into shore.

Then, you’ll be faced with a series of cliff jumps ranging from a 10-ft technical jump to a 30-ft jump off another waterfall. Throughout the adventure you will have opportunities to swim, river-float, down-climb, hike and maneuver your way through the rustic canyon. After the tour, you’ll share your stories with your group over fresh tropical fruit, beers and water before heading on your way to a local restaurant for a typical Costa Rican lunch.

When you are ready we will drive another 45 minutes and then drop you off at your hotel in Arenal.
