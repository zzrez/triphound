Our Costa Rica Rainforest Waterfall Tour will get you off the beaten path, up in to the Costa Rica rainforest, down under the lush green canopy, and in to the natural spring waters of some of Costa Rica’s most pristine waterfalls.

Jump in to our 4x4 custom safari vehicles with your bilingual guide and you’re in to secondary rainforest in no time. Within minutes you will be passing a small waterfall and climbing up in to the Costa Rican backcountry.

...Breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, the Nicoya Peninsula, Playa Hermosa, and protected national rainforest.

On the way up our 2000ft. ascent you will pass through beautiful Costa Rica rainforest, a gorgeous teak farm, and have the chance to see a variety of local wildlife.

When cresting at the top of our 2000ft trip you will arrive at breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, the Nicoya Peninsula, Playa Hermosa, and protected national rainforest.

After the chance to get your once-in-a-lifetime photos of the scoping views and Costa Rican countryside, you will be descending down to the first basins and streams that lay just below the mouth of a pure Costa Rica spring.

A short five-minute walk under the shade of the canopy of the Costa Rica rainforest and through a lush and maintained walking trail, and you will arrive at our destination…

Waterfalls Pura Vida! Hop in, cool off and enjoy the serenity of this natural paradise. For the thrill seekers there are jumping points around the falls.

After a delicious Costa Rican fruit snack and a chance to explore all around the area, we are on our way through the amazing scenery and back to Adventure Tours’ Headquarters.

Just another day in paradise!
