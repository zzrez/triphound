Adventure Connection San Jose to Arenal Coffee Plantation and La Paz Waterfall

You will be picked up at your San José hotel and from there, visit the breathtaking La Paz waterfall for some amazing photo ops outside the fall and spot birds, butterflies, monkeys, and maybe even some sloths.

We will then move on along the winding mountain roads. You’ll notice a change in altitude as the temperature gets cooler and the type of vegetation changes--there are a lot of coffee, flower, fern and strawberry plantations higher in the mountains.

We then arrive to a local coffee farm cooperative. Enjoy an interesting tour at a coffee plantation where you will learn about the history and importance of coffee in Costa Rican culture. You will also enjoy a delicious traditional Costa Rican lunch before continuing on to the Arenal Volcano.
