Your tour begins with a pick-up in Jaco or Los Suenos. A drive of about 15 minutes transports you to a lush oasis spread across 80 private acres of untouched natural beauty. Home to some of the region’s best-kept horses, you meet your steed at the ranch. After some safety instruction with an experienced guide, you set off for a relaxed ride.

Perfect for new and novice riders, the unhurried outing winds along rainforest trails dense with tropical flora. Your guide points out some native plants, encouraging you to breathe in the sweet scents of lemon and mango leaves. The guide also educates on the transitional forest’s important place in the local ecosystem.

But not only humans and horses reside in the rich rainforest. As you trot along, you’re apt to pass white-faced monkeys romping through the treetops as rainbow-feathered scarlet macaws and yellow-billed toucans soar through the air. Keep an eye out for colorful dart frogs and iguanas perched in the trees.

You dismount to the soft sound of cascading water in the distance. A short walk reveals a secluded triple waterfall that empties into a natural swimming pool. Should you leap from the rock platform or plunge down a natural slide? Why not both? After a refreshing swim under the falling water, you mount up and ride back to the ranch where you’re greeted with a bounty of fresh tropical fruit.

An exclusive horse adventure, trail riding through a pristine rainforest creates indelible memories of your visit to Costa Rica.

Tour de la Gloria may be our shortest ATV tour but it packs in big fun. Set off from the center of Jacó and you’ll soon ascend a rainforest trail that rises to a lookout point with sprawling views over Jacó Beach and the Nicoya Peninsula. Whip astride mountain peaks above a rich jungle canopy and take a break to refresh at a secluded mountain cantina. On the return, enjoy a stop at a small waterfall.

Tour de la Paz takes you on a three-hour ride through the mountainous landscape that backs Jacó Beach. Tear along trails through primary rainforest to spots with sweeping vistas across the Pacific coast stretching south to Manuel Antonio Park and north to the port of Puntarenas. This tour also stops at a towering waterfall that empties into a natural swimming pool where you can take a 15-foot leap from a rock platform. On the descent back to town, loop along the edge of Carara National Park.

Perfect for both the experienced and thrill-seeking newbies, the two-hour-long Jacó Canopy Tour offers wild zip-line rides close to the town of Jacó. Climb to elevated platforms that offer spectacular views across rainforest terrain that’s home to brilliant scarlet macaws and white-faced monkeys. Peer out over Pacific waters and an amazing waterfall from the lofty perches. Then fly down a dozen high-speed zip lines that will get your adrenaline going.

These amazing adventure tours are sure to be highlights of your Costa Rica vacation!
