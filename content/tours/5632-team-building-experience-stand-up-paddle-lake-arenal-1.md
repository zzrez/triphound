advice: "This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition without any recent surgery, heart condition, pregnancy, disability or injury. You should know how to swim and feel comfortable in water. We cannot guarantee you will not fall off of board while SUP. Desafio Adventure Company reserves the right to cancel any trip due to unsafe conditions and will only run a tour according to established company policies.

For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."

Team Building Experience Stand Up Paddle on Lake Arenal - customizable especially for you!

As we embark on our journey out to the middle of the lake, you’ll be blown away by all of the natural beauty of Lake Arenal. The mountains that surround the lake are different shades of green, as some are in the foreground while the others fade into the distance. At first, the Arenal Volcano seems like it is hidden behind mountains, but if you get to a certain part in the lake you’ve reached the sweet spot – a spot where you can see the detailed textures of its rock formation and where passing in front of it can make you feel tiny. When you reach the middle of the lake, your guide will give you plenty of safety instructions and plunk your board into the water.

Paddle out on your knees and when you are ready, stand up and find your balance! The calm waters in Arenal make this a perfect sport for people of all ages and all skill levels.

It’s a great activity for people who just want to be on a freshwater lake, soaking up the sun in gorgeous scenery with plenty of opportunity for conversation.

About half way through the tour we’ll paddle to an island where the next part of the adventure begins. We'll split up your group into teams and you'll participate in activities like:

\+ Stand Up Paddle Races

\+ Follow the clues to find treasures

\+ Survivor! Who can create their boat the fastest?

\+ Fun techniques and tricks on your paddle board

These activities are perfect for companies and groups who would like to improve communication, leadership, innovation, and team work. After all their hard work, relax, crack open the cooler and fuel up with a refreshing and well-deserved BBQ. Que Rico!
