advice: "Our exclusive, PRIVATE trips include private transport to and from your hotel, you get our most-experienced, top bilingual guides to accompany you, personalized choice of food options, no sense of rushing along - you can take your time, plus you get your photos included. Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian or kosher, etc. and we will try to accommodate you to the best of our abilities.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Canyoning in the Lost Canyon - Private Tour

Looking for an exclusive, private, multi-sport experience during your vacation in Costa Rica? Book a private canyoning tour and be treated like Kings of the Jungle! You'll have your own guides and transport on this exciting rainforest adventure that will have you rappelling, jumping, climbing, zipping on a guided rappel and hiking deep into the jungle! Private tours in Costa Rica are a great way to enjoy adventure on your own!

We will pick you up at your hotel in the Arenal Volcano area and take you to your Jungle Limo. These well-equipped Land Cruiser 4x4s will take you up the side of the mountain to the Lost Canyon Ops Center.

When you arrive, you will be greeted by your adventure guides who will suit you up with your helmet, harness and gloves. There are secure lockers to leave your belongings behind.

You guides will give you thorough safety instructions, do some demonstrations, have you practice a bit and have you laughing along the way!

Start off the rappelling part of your adventure with the first waterfall referred to as the “Baby” -- a small, 10ft waterfall that allows you to practice and ease your way into learning the ropes - literally!

Then hike deep into the rocky terrain of the wet and wild rainforest, surrounded by huge rocks, trees, and flowing streams. You’ll soon reach the “Big Boy” - the second largest waterfall. Imagine this: there you are, on a sturdy platform looking down into the depths of a massive 150-ft tropical waterfall. You’ll start off by rappelling down the rock face and about half way through you’ll hear “LET GO!” – a few moments later you’ll have experienced your first guided, adrenaline pumping free fall! This is when you will realize that this really is an experience of a lifetime!

Canyoneering in Costa Rica is more than just rappelling in waterfalls; it’s a full body work out! Use your arms, legs, and hands to climb through Mother Nature’s obstacle course: You’ll be jumping into pools, sliding down a natural water slide, sitting under waterfalls, pulling yourself up some rocks and helping yourself down others. As you make your way through the four rappels, you’ll notice your strength and confidence keeps getting stronger and stronger… good thing, because the waterfalls keep getting bigger and BIGGER.

You will finish your adventure with a 200-ft waterfall drop -- you will be rappelling part of the way and then letting go of the reins to experience another guided free fall drop! Talk about adrenaline!

As we hike back up the rainforest canyon, you’ll be invited to take your time and enjoy the serenity of the rain forest. It normally takes about 10 minutes, but many people take longer, stopping every so often to soak in this unique experience. At the top, change into your dry clothes and head up to the Canyon Café where there will be a well-deserved homemade lunch waiting for you we like to call the WARRIOR BUFFET! A photographer will be with you along the way.
