advice: "Our exclusive, PRIVATE trips include private transport to and from your hotel, you get our most-experienced, top bilingual guides to accompany you, personalized choice of food options, no sense of rushing along - you can take your time, plus you get your photos included. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"
