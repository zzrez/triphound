From beginners at our Kayak School learning peel outs and ferry angles, to more advanced kayakers, everyone can enjoy the many sections of our nice river.

From mild to wild, we have the fun and scenery you have been looking for. We have hard shell and inflatable kayaks to rent to experienced paddlers. Also local guides will lead intermediate and expert paddlers on more challenging sections of our river.
