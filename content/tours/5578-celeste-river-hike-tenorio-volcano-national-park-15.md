"Celeste" in Spanish means celestial, paradisiacal and also the light blue color of the clear sky. Such adjectives describe perfectly the area we�ll visit on this tour.

On the flanks of Tenorio Volcano National Park this 7 km hike takes us to the point in the river where Mother Nature magically mixes the water of two crystal-clear streams, changing its color to the beautiful light-blue we call Celeste. We continue to "las ollas" (the cooking pots), depressions on the ground full of clay with alleged therapeutic properties and the Tenorio Volcano thermal springs. The trail continues through the forest to reach the stunningly colored Rio Celeste Waterfall.

All this time the surrounding cloud forest is full of amazing life forms, smells and sounds.

This unique hike combines nature's beauty with a great opportunity to observe wonderful flora and fauna. During our hike through the Tenorio Volcano National Park we will pass by the River Celeste Lagoon and walk along two crystal-clear streams coming together to form the Rio Celeste.

Here the clear waters mysteriously change into a beautifully bright, light-blue color (hence the name �Light-Blue River�). Walking along jungle trails, we visit an area where volcanic smoke is expelled at high temperatures from the ground. The stunning colored Rio Celeste Waterfall offers an amazing view.
