If you want the private, VIP, all-included, full-day, beach to bluff tour of the Central Pacific coast - look no further.

The Tour del Rey promises your personal guide to customize the tour to your our pace and preferences.

El Tour del Rey is our longest single-day tour and can cover nearly 100 kilometers of beaches, waterfalls, rivers, rainforest, countryside, small villages, hidden bars and restaurants.

If you want the private, VIP, all-included, full-day tour of Costa Rica- look no further.

The tour begins in the mountains directly behind Jacó, and continues roughly half the distance to the peak of the mountain to a beautiful 35ft. waterfall (Cascada del Zorro) – a perfect spot to get a little wet and take some photos.

After the brief stop, we continue up through primary rainforest and above the canopy to the top of the mountain range. Just beyond the crest of the mountain lies a beautiful mirador offering views of the ocean playing against sands as far south as Manuel Antonio, as far west as the Nicoya Peninsula, and as far north as the port city of Puntarenas.

We enjoy a cool drink with the view, and then continue along the ridgeline of the mountains that offer more incredible views of this pristine area. This primary rainforest leads the way towards the mountains that surround Playa Hermosa.

After stopping off at one more epic viewpoint, we descend the mountains of La Gloria toward the Tulin River to our river-side lunch spot in the small rural town of Mata de Platano.

Once fed, we start a new climb through the similarly small and remote villages of Montelimar, Angostura, Pavona and San Gabriel before passing through Las Delicias (population: 39) famous for its ATV and motocross rallies.

Though it’s impossible to describe every little pueblo we pass on the tour, suffice it to say that each has its own unique charm, and the locals always greet us with a wave and a smile.

Once arriving in Bijagual - the last mountain pueblo we pass - we begin our final descent to a beach-side bar where we gather refreshments for the end of our beach run. A quick 2 kilometer run alongside the Pacific Ocean brings us to a view of the sun making its way for the Nicoya Peninsula on the other side of the Gulf, and chance to have a drink before heading back to Headquarters.
