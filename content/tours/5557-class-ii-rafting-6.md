bring: "*   Women: bathing suit, shorts and t-shirt preferably with sleeves to protect them from the sun.
*   Men: swim trunks and t-shirt.
*   Everyone has to wear shoes, the options are: strap sandals (Teva, Keen); water shoes or tennis shoes (NEVER flip flops or sandals without a back)."
advice: "*   Take sun block, a hat, glasses (optional):
    Apply sun block on arms, the front of legs and the back of the neck moderately.  Don not apply sun block on the back of legs because when in contact with water it will become very slippery and will increase the chances of falling out of the raft; nor on the forehead because when in contact with water it may drip onto eyes causing irritation.*   If wanted, you may bring a hat to wear under the helmet.
    *   If glasses are taken they must have a device to secure them, like a strap.
*   Waterproof camera, bottle of water (optional).
*   Please do not take jewelry or valuable objects, because they might get lost in the river."

Class II Rafting

This tour begins in a beautiful private property called La Linda, where ornamental plants are grown for exportation. The complete tour lasts for 1:30 hours to 2 hours, all the way to the facilities of Adventures of Sarapiquí, where the trip ends, and it runs for a distance of about 9 kilometers (5.5 miles). It is a very nice and convenient trip for families with kids between the ages of 6-8 years old, that want to enjoy some nice and exciting rapids, but that requires less experience and is less difficult for the rowers.
