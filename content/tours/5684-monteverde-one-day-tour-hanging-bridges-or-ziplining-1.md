advice: "For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoning (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Monteverde One Day Tour from Arenal: Hanging Bridges or Ziplining

Get ready to embark on our adventurous taxi-boat-taxi journey to Monteverde and eperience the best of the Monteverde Cloud Forest!

This One Day Tour includes a scenic boat ride on Lake Arenal and allows you to see the Monteverde Cloud Forest for a long, but enjoyable full day of adventure! If you don't have time to stay overnight in Monteverde, we suggest you try this one day tour!

We’ll pick you up at your Arenal hotel and drive to Lake Arenal where you will meet up with your boat driver. Then, you’ll hop on board the Desafio boat and cross the lake while admiring the beautiful views of all of the mountains, amazing sky and the colossal Arenal volcano.

When you reach the other side of the lake, you’ll be picked up and driven to Monteverde where you can choose between a one-of-a-kind canopy ziplining adventure or a hanging bridges tour of the Cloud Forest! Whichever tour you choose, you’ll be high above the Cloud Forest canopy and able to see it from a bird's-eye view!

For ziplining, you’re in for a treat! Strap on your harness and get ready for an adventure filled with action, excitement and speed! The zipline canopy tour allows you to fly like a bird from tree-to-tree and canyon-to-canyon through 1.7 miles of zipline cables. You will be up high in the mountains for a great view of the area. You’ll witness the best views of the Cloud Forest and its mountains and deep jungle canyons.

From there, your guide will give you instructions and safety tips before embarking on your journey across 10 zipline cables that reach between 40 to 100 meters high and up to 750 meters long. You won’t want to miss out on an adventure like this!

For those who also enjoy a more tranquil, scenic experience above the cloud forest canopy, you'll love the hanging bridges! Designed for bird-watchers and nature lovers alike, the hanging bridges offer stunning views of the Cloud Forest and it’s inhabitants. Walk across a series of five bridges, spanning over 1.5 miles, and up to 100 meters long with our experienced naturalist guides who will point out wildlife, plant species and offer fun facts about Costa Rica.

Both tours will provide you with an adventure of a lifetime and you’ll be guaranteed to leave with lots of memories to share with your friends and family back home! After your tour, enjoy a delicious traditional lunch and then head back to Arenal with the taxi-boat-taxi right to the doorstep of your La Fortuna hotel before the day is done.
