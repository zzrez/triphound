advice: "Read about our FAQs on Canyoning in Costa Rica and check out Desafio's video of Gravity Falls to get a better understanding of Costa Rica's MOST Extreme Tour!This is a great tour to do from San Jose Costa Rica and we can arrange this special Gravity Falls Waterfall Jumping canyoning expedition as a Desafio Adventure Connection where your journey is the adventure! Be sure to ask one of our Adventure Specialists to help you with your reservations.And combine Gravity Falls with mountain Biking and rafting to get do our Triple Threat Extreme Gravity COMBO!This tour is considered an extreme adventure and advisable for those who are athletic and physically fit ages 16-55. No experience necessary. There are different jump heights throughout the tour and paths in case you decide to skip a jump - but the idea is to push yourself to your limits on this Costa Rica extreme tour Gravity Falls!Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition to attempt it. While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you may be able to do these tours.For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our company policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run.Some hotels out of our normal pick-up zone may be me charged an extra drop-off and pick-up fee."
