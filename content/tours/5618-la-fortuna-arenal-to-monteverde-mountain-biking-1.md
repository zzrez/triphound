advice: "Your luggage stays in our vehicles and our driver stays with your items while you are doing your La Fortuna to Monteverde Mountain Biking tour. Extra transport charge for drop-off outside of our regular hotel zone.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions and will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you should be in good physical condition."

Adventure Connection Arenal and La Fortuna to Monteverde Mountain Biking

This La Fortuna Arenal to Monteverde Adventure Connection Mountain Bike trip allows you to do an adventure as part of your travel day!

Mountain biking is the perfect way to stretch your legs and get energized during your car trip.

Costa Rica is the home to an abundance of wildlife, refreshing rivers, impressive volcanoes and amazing rainforests. Come see Costa Rica up-close and personal on a top-quality mountain bike. Ride along rich farmlands, close to the jungle and along the base of the Monteverde mountains. Bike through 13 Kilometers of tranquil Costa Rican countryside as you explore Costa Rica’s diverse natural environment with chances to see wildlife such as monkeys, birds, coatimundis, and sometimes even sloths and toucans!

About half way though, you’ll make a stop to have some refreshing tropical fruit and cool off in a river or in Lake Arenal. You'll be moved by the friendliness of Costa Rican country folk, who are bound to smile and wave at you, as you pass through their communities.

After your Arenal to Monteverde biking tour is over, you’ll finish the day off by a relaxing and scenic ride in our air-conditioned van to get to your new vacation destination!
