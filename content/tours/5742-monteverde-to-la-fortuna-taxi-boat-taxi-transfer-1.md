What a great way to enjoy your journey up to the Cloud Forests of Monteverde from the Arenal Volcano! We pick you up in your hotel and take you to our boat on the beautiful Lake Arenal. You then ride for about 45 minutes on the pristine Lake Arenal with great views of the Arenal Volcano from behind. You then get to the other side of Lake Arenal and (may have to carry your luggage a bit in order to) board our van that is waiting to take you to Monteverde.
