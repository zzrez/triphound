Costa Rica Whitewater Rafting Class 3 Sarapiqui River - the only Afternoon Rafting Trip in Arenal!

Have an exciting time on the class 3 Sarapiqui rafting trip. The Sarapiqui River area is famous for its lush rainforest scenery. In fact, we call this section of the river The Jungle Run because you are bound to see monkeys, iguanas and other amazing Costa Rican wildlife along the banks of this beautiful river for rafting.

As soon as you're fitted with safety gear and instructions, you'll hit the Sarapiqui river and make your way down rolling rapids while your guide directs the raft and calls out directions...

"Paddle Hard!" "Right Paddle!" "Back Paddle!" "Get Down!"

Duck, dodge, paddle, and laugh your way down the river as your heart races and your eyes dance with excitement! Along the way, our "paparrazzi" photographer will be around to catch the best action shots as your Costa Rica river adventure unfolds.

About half way down this incredible Costa Rica river, enjoy a refreshing tropical fruit snack, relax with the rest of the group, go for a swim, or just take in the class 2 rushing waters around you! The birdwatching opportunities in the afternoon are amazing, so you'll also have the chance to spot a variety of interesting birds.

Finish the day with a snack meal at our own restaurant The Red Eyed Frog right on the river before heading back to your hotel on our comfortable air-conditioned van with FREE WiFi.

Be sure to post your photos to Facebook and Instagram as you rest up in your hotel so your friends and family can see how much fun you are having in Costa Rica!
