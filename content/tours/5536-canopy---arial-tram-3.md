The Jaco Beach and Los Suenos Rainforest Canopy Zip lining and Tram (Tranopy) ride offers you the best of both worlds giving beginning zipliners an exciting way to experience the fun of a Costa Rica canopy zipline tour, while also offering a peaceful and informative tram-ride up the rainforest.

The unique hands-free zipline rig make this descent a truly stress-free adrenaline rush.

Open-air trams lift you through the rainforest canopy surrounding Jaco Beach and Los Suenos where gorgeous fauna, trickling waterfalls, hidden streams and exciting wildlife – from Scarlet Macaws to White-Faced Monkeys - await. On this ascent, your professional naturalist guides describe in intricate detail the unspoiled beauty that surrounds you as they open the conversation up for an enlightening group discussion.

Once atop the mountain, thrill-seekers harness up and begin their descent back to the base on a state-of-the-art 15-cable zipline that connects this series of elevated platforms. Not only are the views incredible, the added freedom of enjoying the only hands-free zipline in the Jaco Beach and Los Suenos area make this descent a truly stress-free adrenaline rush.

Safety is the primary concern of all of the government-certified professional guides, and all equipment is inspected routinely.
