Manuel Antonio Park is Costa Rica’s most visited National Park. Manuel Antonio’s beautiful beaches, amazing diversity of wildlife and extensive system of hiking trails bring nearly 150,000 visitors per year.

With an unequaled 109 species of mammals and 184 species of birds congregated around four pristine white sand beaches, Manuel Antonio offers both exploration and relaxation to all those who are lucky enough to visit.

An amazing zoological experience in the heart of the rainforest.

The full-day group tour of Manuel Antonio begins on the park’s walking trail with your bilingual government-certified naturalist guide. Along the trail your guide is sure to point out a variety of the park’s monkeys, coatis, sloths, exotic birds, and lizards. An amazing zoological experience in the heart of the rainforest.

At the end of the walking trail, we arrive at the park’s beautiful white-sand beaches providing an opportunity to cool off and swim, or just lie on the beach and soak-in the scenery.

Just outside the exit of Manuel Antonio’s National Park lies an array of restaurants and local craftsmen vending their artesania beachside. We give you a chance to stroll and shop for souvenirs, and then we stop for lunch at a delicious little restaurant right on the coast.

After our late lunch, we head back to Jacó to enjoy the evening, and get some rest for the next day’s adventure.
