San Jose to La Fortuna Rafting Sarapiqui Class 3 and 4

Add an exciting travel experience to your day of travel from San Jose to La Fortuna Arenal and go rafting on one of Costa Rica's most exuberant rivers! The Sarapiqui River is considered one of the "Must-Do" Costa Rica Arenal rafting tours in the wet and wild Northern Zone of Costa Rica. Let the journey be your adventure!

Bring on the adrenaline and enjoy the “Jungle Run” on the Sarapiqui River, the perfect rafting trip for adventurous paddlers! We'll pick you up at your hotel and travel through small Costa Rican villages to the quaint town of San Miguel de Sarapiquí.

There, your professional rafting guide will give you the 101 on rafting including safety tips and technical instructions before heading on your 2 hour journey down one of Costa Rica’s most exuberant rivers! During your decent down the river, you will experience over 30 exciting rapids along 10 km of lush, vibrant rainforest.

As you make your way through exciting rapids like “The Pipeline,” “The Terminator,” and “Dos Locos”, we’ll be sure to get your adrenaline pumping! About half way down the river, you’ll stop and watch the rapids from the shore, while enjoying refreshing tropical fruit and relaxing with the rest of the group.

Then, after the second leg of your rafting journey, you’ll finish the tour with an unforgettable homemade lunch before heading to your next vacation destination!
