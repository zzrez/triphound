advice: "We are a company that prides itself in sound ecological and sustainable tourism practices. We adhere to Costa Rica National Park guidelines to stay on authorized paths and do not permit the extraction of plants or the feeding of wild animals.Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Arenal Volcano National Park Hike and Ecotermales Hot Springs Combo Tour with Dinner

This is the quintessential Arenal Volcano tour to do when you’re in La Fortuna! The Arenal Volcano Rainforest and Natural History tour takes you through lush rainforest along the base of Costa Rica's most-famous, iconic volcano.

Our experienced, bilingual naturalist guide will point out interesting plants and wildlife in the vibrant primary and secondary rainforest of the Arenal Volcano National Park. You’ll then arrive to the observation point of the Arenal Volcano -- this is the closest you can get to the base of the Arenal Volcano -- and the perfect vantage point to take remarkable photos as the sun sets behind the Arenal Volcano.

Then it's time to head to EcoTermales Hot Springs to enjoy 2 hot springs pool areas with a bar, locker rooms, restaurant & family-style, easy-going atmosphere. Afterwards, eat a delicious dinner at the resort before being transported back to your hotel in our Desafio vans with FREE WiFi.
