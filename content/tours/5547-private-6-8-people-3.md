This Private Tortuga Island Tour with Captain Mike Alligood lets you enjoy all the white sands, crystal waters, tropical fish, and unspoiled natural beauty of Tortuga Island PLUS, you get to add some Costa Rica Fishing in to the mix. No need to get on the bus with the throngs of tourists headed to Puntarenas, our private tour of Tortuga Island leaves right from Los Suenos.

Your private cruise leaving from the Los Suenos Marina takes you through the beautiful Gulf of Nicoya. The trip across the bay to Tortuga Island is about an hour on this top-of-the-line 31-foot state-of-the-art twin-engine Contender with air conditioned cabin, and bathroom. You’ll have the chance to see dolphins, sailfish, and even humpback whales.

There are a variety of activities to enjoy on your tour of Tortuga Island. Snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, or just simply relaxing in the warm sun with a cold drink are among the favorites.

Delicious food, fruits and drinks are all prepared for you by Los Suenos’ favorite restaurant - The Hook Up. And, of course, a friendly bilingual crew is always with you to ensure that your experience on Tortuga Island and in the Gulf of Nicoya is a memorable one.
