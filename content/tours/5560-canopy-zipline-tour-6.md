The group is received by our guides at Aventuras Del Sarapiqui base camp, where bathrooms and changing rooms can be found. Those that arrive via their own transportation leave their vehicles here, and we will transport you to the starting point (a 10 minute trip). Once at the starting point, each person will receive their equipment, to be adjusted by the guides. The guides will explain safety rules and instructions. The trip will last approximately 2 hours. It includes 14 zip lines between platforms of aluminum and earth. Among the trees used for the tour are 3 Almendrons, 1 Gavilan, 1 Aceituno and a majestic Ceibo; whose height offers a beautiful view of the river. During the tour, guests take 3 short hikes that rise more than 300 feet total via trails adequate for hikers of all capabilities. During the trip, guides will choose a stop to relax and will provide snacks ans water. The stop allows guests a moment to connect with nature, simulates observation and learning to hear the sounds of birds and insects in the forest.
