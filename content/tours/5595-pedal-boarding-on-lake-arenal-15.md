This Pedal Board tour will take you gliding across the calm and peaceful waters of Lake Arenal that sits at the foot of the breathtaking Arenal Volcano, just outside of La Fortuna. Although it sounds familiar to Stand Up Paddle Boarding, it is very different. In fact, the board is powered by the strongest part of your body, your legs, and allows you to grasp the firm handlebars for balance, making this activity easy and fun for people of all ages.

As you glide across the water with precision and ease, you can use the intuitive steering system to go where you want to go and use the pedals to glide at two different speeds � step forward for a slower, easier pace or step backwards for a faster ride and harder workout.

In the Arenal region we are blessed to have Lake Arenal because it is the perfect place to go Pedal Boarding. This peaceful freshwater lake is surrounded by large rolling hills, farmer�s fields, and the impressive Arenal Volcano. You will be so close to the volcano that you can see the details of the dried up lava flow from its last eruption decades ago. It has since been active but is currently dormant, with no signs of lava flow in years.

Your professional guide will lead your group, pedaling towards the Arenal Volcano and pointing out interesting wildlife that you may find on the shore or birds flying overhead. Halfway through the tour, we�ll pull up on shore and take a break, having a chance to go for a swim, take photos, and enjoy some refreshments.
