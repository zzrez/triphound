advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 13-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Guanacaste Day Tour: Barra Honda Caves (Spelunking)

It wasn’t until the 1960s that the Barra Honda Cave system was discovered and studied, because before that everyone thought it was a volcano! The sound of the whirling bats was mistaken for the sound of rumbling volcanic activity, and the smell of bat feces was misinterpreted to be the smell of volcanic sulfur! Until this day, only 19 of the 42 caves have been explored and only one of them is safe enough for the public to visit. However, visiting this one cave is enough to fill your day with adventure, mystery and beauty.

You’ll start the day with safety instructions, and be suited up with a helmet, headlight, and harness. It will get darker and darker as you get further and further down the ladder and deep into the cave. See and touch the amazing stalactites, stalagmites and other artistic limestone formations as you explore the caves using your hands and feet to slide along the smooth stone cave walls.

You’ll head through a series of rooms, squeezing your way through some and ducking down into others. This truly is an authentic cave experience! Next, explore the tropical dry forest within Barra Honda National Park. Admire the natural beauty and wildlife that you will encounter – lots of exotic vegetation, birds and monkeys!

Then, when you are ready, relax and enjoy a delicious lunch in a local restaurant before being transported back to your hotel just in time for sunset!
