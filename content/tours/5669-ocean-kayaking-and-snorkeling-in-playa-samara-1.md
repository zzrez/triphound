advice: "NOTE: We may have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone (1-8pax) – please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing.

For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica.

Ocean Kayaking and Snorkeling in Playa Samara

This is some of the best kayaking and snorkeling in Costa Rica. Start from Samara beach and enjoy a kayak trip across the bay to a deserted white sand beach on Isla Chora. This island is a refreshing ascape to an underwater world. Here, you are free to snorkel with tropical fish, splash in clear waters or simply sit and take in the rays. Bask in the balance of a tour that includes both holiday exercise and ease. A great opportunity to view the marine wildlife of Costa Rica's Pacific coast.
