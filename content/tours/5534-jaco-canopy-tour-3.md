The Jaco Canopy tour is not for the timid. This intermediate to advanced Jaco zip lining tour is recommended for experienced thrill-seekers and daring first-timers.

More than just an adrenaline rush, the elevated platforms and cables give you the chance to see a beautiful waterfall, incredible wildlife - from Scarlet Macaws to White-faced Monkeys - as well as breathtaking views of Jaco Costa Rica and the Nicoya Peninsula.

...Definitely the most adventurous of our local options.

Safety is the primary concern of all of the government-certified professional guides, and all equipment is inspected routinely.

With 12 Cables and a much higher speed of decent, the Jaco Canopy is definitely the most adventurous of our local options. Unrivaled views and a super-friendly bilingual staff make this Costa Rica canopy tour a thrill-seekers dream.
