Our sustainable safari will take us to see the best landscapes along the forests of the Peñas Blancas River. The great variety of flora and fauna are the main attractions and we will enjoy the peace and harmony of nature in the Northern region of Costa Rica. We will have the opportunity to visit Don Pedro�s farm, where we can observe the lifestyle of the Costa Rican farmers and enjoy a delicious homemade snack. You will help to protect our forests by planting a tree, in this way to be part of a conscientious and sustainable tourism.
