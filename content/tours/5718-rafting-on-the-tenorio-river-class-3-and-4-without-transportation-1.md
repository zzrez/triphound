advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

Recommended ages 13-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling), rafting and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) and life jackets are rated for over 220 lbs, but the maximum waist size for the harnesses and life jackets used for these tours is usually about 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still probably do these tours. One other concern is that if you are more than 220 lbs and fall out of a raft, it may be challenging for a raft guide to pull you back in, so please take this into conisderation while booking your tour."

Rafting on the Tenorio River Class 3 and 4 Without transportation

Costa Rica has some of the best whitewater rafting options in the whole world! Be sure to go white water rafting when you are staying at the beach in Guanacaste or Playa Samara -- it will be one of your best days ever in Costa Rica is you go rafting with us!

This description is for rafting clients who have rented a car or have their own transportation. (Please note that we also offer transportation from your Guanacaste hotel and our Adventure Connection Transfer + Tour option from Arenal or Monteverde.) We have ample, safe parking at our Tenorio Outpost, so feel free to leave your vehicle behind.

Once you've arrived at our Tenorio Outpost Operations Center and Restaurant located on the PanAmerican Highway next to the Corobici River Bridge (located about 1 hour and 45 minutes from Liberia and about 8 minutes before you arrive to Canas), we'll have you sign our Waiver form and tell you a little about current conditions on the river.

Your guides will then get you loaded up into our All-Terrain-Tenorio 4x4 and drive about 45 minutes across the rustic Costa Rican back roads, through gorgeous mountains and quaint villages until we reach the Tenorio River private put-in.

Your professional guides will give you a safety briefing about your rafting expedition including safety tips and technical instructions.

Now you're ready to head out on your 2.5-hour journey down one of Costa Rica’s most famous rivers!

You’ll witness the impressive canyon of the Tenorio River along with many different types of flora and fauna - there is a unique contrast of the red rocks against the green plants that line the canyon. Your guide will try to point out birds, monkeys and other types of wildlife as you make your way through highly technical and tight rapids along the way.

You’ll experience over 20 thrilling rapids, and finish the tour by going over Costa Rica's most extreme whitewater rapid that we have named Cascabel Falls – an intense 12-ft waterfall drop!

After this rafting tour is over, you'll be treated to some snacks and then hike a bit up to where your 4x4 transportation is waiting for you to take you back on another 35-minute ride back though wild, rustic Costa Rican roads to return to the Tenorio Outpost restaurant. You will have an opportunity to change your clothing and enjoy a delicious traditional Costa Rican lunch!
