Ocean Kayaking and Snorkeling in Manuel Antonio

As you head out of the Pacific ocean on a double kayak you will see interesting scenery and even sea creatures like schools of angel fish. About halfway through kayaking you'll stop by a quiet bay and snorkel for about 30 minutes and see school of colorful fish, parrotfish and starfish. When you return to shore you will be invited to a delicious homemade meal before being dropped off at your hotel.
