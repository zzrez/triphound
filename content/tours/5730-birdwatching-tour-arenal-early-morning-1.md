Guided Birdwatching Tour at Arenal Volcano

The Arenal Mundo Aventura reserve is the perfect location for birdwatching, known for the amazing concentation of birdlife! The elusive tropical birds of Costa Rica are best spotted in the wee hours of the morning or also close to sunset.

You will see a wide-array of exotic birds from toucans, parrots, Montezuma Oropendolas, colorful tanagers and parakeets. If you are a more-serious birdwatcher, your guide will use his eagle-eyes to spot the harder-to-see birds such as Royal Flycatchers, White-fronted Nunbirds, Cinnamon Woodpeckers and other more-difficult-to-see bird species in Costa Rica.

Since there are a reported 840 species of birds found in Costa Rica, you are bound to leave this tour having seen plenty of amazing birdlife!
