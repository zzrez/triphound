advice: "Due to border control restrictions, it is MANDATORY that all tourists participating in the Caño Negro or One Day Nicaragua tour carry with them their original passport or a copy of their passport with a copy of the entrance stamp they received in immigration upon entering Costa Rica. Under NO circumstances will any other type of identification -- such as state ID, driver's license, etc. -- be accepted. The Cano Negro Wildlife Refuge Boat Tour is a perfect activity for families and birdwatchers. We can also arrange hotel accommodations and fishing expeditions in the Los Chiles and Cano Negro area near the Nicaragua Boarder. Your passport or a copy of your passport and Costa Rica entrance stamp is required for the tour. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge Boat Tour along Rio Frio

On this nature and wildlife boat tour, you'll take a peaceful ride in a covered motorboat along Rio Frio to appreciate the beautiful flora and fauna of one of the most biologically diverse areas in Costa Rica and the world!

The Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge encompasses an area of about 10,000 hectares near the border with Nicaragua. The wildlife in this area is truly spectacular, especially the birds! It's one of the few places in Costa Rica where you can catch a glimpse of the exotic Jabiru Stork, the tallest flying bird found in Central and South America. You will get the opportunity to likely see wood storks, cormorants, and other varieties of birds -- this is a must-do tour for avid birdwatchers! Plus, everyone loves to spot the sloths, howler monkeys, and caimans (like mini-crocodiles) that inhabit this lush area.

The travel time from La Fortuna to the Caño Negro area is about 1.5 hours and you will board the boat with your nature guide at the Los Chiles dock. It is a comfortable ride with a covered top on the boat, but it is important to bring a hat and sunscreen -- of course you will also want to bring your camera and binoculars. You will travel by boat along the edge of the Caño Negro Wildlife refuge on Rio Frio for about 2 hours and return to the same dock. From there, you will enjoy a delicious lunch at a local restaurant.

You then return back in the van to your hotel. This is sure to be an unforgettable trip with memories and great photos to share with everyone!

Your passport or a copy of your passport and Costa Rica entrance stamp is required for the tour.
