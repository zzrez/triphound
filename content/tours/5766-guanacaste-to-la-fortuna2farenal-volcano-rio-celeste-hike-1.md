advice: "The Río Celeste waterfall may lose its blue color during rainstorms. Our policy is to advise clients the day of the tour if it is raining in the area and offer the tour for the following day, should clients want to postpone or change to a different tour. No refunds for inclement weather. Swimming not permitted in the river.Your luggage stays in our vehicles and our driver stays with your items while you are doing your tour. We have private entrances and exits for our rafting tour locations. Extra transport charge for drop-off outside of our regular hotel zone. Please note this Adventure Connection requires a minimum of 4 passengers in this direction from Guanacaste to Arenal.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you should be in good physical condition."

Adventure Connection Guanacaste to La Fortuna Rio Celeste Hike

Maximize your vacation time by visiting the majestic Rio Celeste during your transfer from Arenal to Guanacaste!

Take an exciting break during your transfer to your new vacation destination! When you reach the Rio Celeste National Park, you’ll embark on a three-hour hike through the lush rainforest, learning about Costa Rican nature and wildlife from your experienced naturalist guide.

Towards the end of the hike, you’ll know when you’ve reached the Celeste River when you see it’s divine turquoise color! As you keep walking you’ll have a chance to see another gorgeous site -- the spectacular Rio Celeste waterfall!

Here, you’ll be able to rest, relax, enjoy some fresh tropical fruit and take lots of photos! To finish off your journey, enjoy a delicious Costa Rican lunch before we drop you off at your new vacation destination.

The Rio Celeste National Park is a beautiful 1.5 hour scenic drive from the Arenal Volcano through the rustic Costa Rican back roads. When you driver from Arenal to the Rio Celeste National Park, you will embark on your 3 hour long hike through the lush rainforest with one of our naturalist guides who will point out exotic wildlife and vegetation such as birds, insects, and sometimes even monkeys and sloths!

After your transportation from Arenal to Rio Celeste, you will be amazed by the beautiful sapphire blue color, which is the result of two rivers joining together, creating a mixture of sulfur and calcium carbonate. Later on in your hike, you’ll reach an impressive waterfall– the perfect place to relax, enjoy the surrounding beauty, and take lots of pictures! To finish off your journey, enjoy a delicious Costa Rican lunch before we drive from Rio Celeste to Tamarindo or other beach locations in Guanacaste and drop you off at your new Costa Rica vacation destination.

Please note: Swimming is not permitted in the river.
