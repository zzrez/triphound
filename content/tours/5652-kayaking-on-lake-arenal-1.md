advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up"

Kayaking on Lake Arenal

Bring your camera because this 2 hour paddle on Central America’s second-largest lake gives you the best views of the behemoth Arenal Volcano and Costa Rican wildlife! Enjoy a pleasant time kayaking on Lake Arenal with breath-taking views of the Arenal Volcano and during your trip, you may observe different species of birds like the “Flycatcher,” “Kingfisher,” “Great Blue Heron” and “Anhinga” and may also possibly hear and see Howler monkeys up in the rainforest trees that surround the lake!

The view is spectacular with the lake on one side of you, and the majestic Arenal Volcano and amazing lush rainforest on the other.

We use high-quality kayaking gear like Ocean Kayak brand single and double kayaks, lifejacket and paddle. We start at one of the the earthen dam that extends across the Southern edge of the lake with paddling instructions and a safety talk so you feel comfortable in your boat. We then go out and explore secluded bays and isolated islands. We'll stop and have some fresh fruit and juice to get some energy and then get back in the kayak and paddle back around to the starting point.

We also recommend you try a Stand Up Paddle while you are at it! You will love this easy-going and relaxing kayaking tour on Lake Arenal in Costa Rica with Desafio.
