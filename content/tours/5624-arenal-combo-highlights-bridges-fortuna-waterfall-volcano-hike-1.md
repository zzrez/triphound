advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.If you are looking for options for the best hiking and best hikes near San Jose, Tamarindo or Liberia, Costa Rica, be sure to check out our Hiking category.We are a company that prides itself in sound ecological and sustainable tourism practices. We adhere to Costa Rica National Park guidelines to stay on authorized paths and do not permit the extraction of plants or the feeding of wild animals.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions! There may be times when the waterfall has a large flow of water and swimming in the pools at the base fo the waterfall, is not recommended, but the visit to the waterfall is still highly recommended.NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone."

Arenal COMBO Tour: Hanging Bridges, Volcano Hike, and La Fortuna Waterfall (includes lunch)

Want to spend an unforgettable day hiking through the lush Costa Rican rainforest, and witness three of the most famous sites in the Arenal, La Fortuna area of Costa Rica? Check out this Arenal Highlights COMBO Tour where you will get to hike across the Arenal Hanging Bridges; take a leisurely nature hike in Arenal National Park -- the closest you’ll get to the Arenal Volcano -- enjoy a delicious lunch and then visit the massive and breathtaking La Fortuna waterfall. This is one of our Top 10 COMBO tours!

Start your day as you hike across the Arenal Hanging Bridges and see the jungle from high above the forest floor. Your naturalist guide will teach you about Costa Rican culture, history, while you experience what we like to call "nature therapy." Emerse yourself in nature while you try to spot different species of plants, animals, and birds along the way.

These trails bring you as close as you’d ever hope to see the rainforest and its inhabitants, as well as give you access to see stunning views of the rainforest and mountains.

After your adventure on the hanging bridges, you will head to the Arenal Volcano National Park.The trails are generally flat and not very strenuous -- perfect for a leisurely and informative hike with one of our naturalist guides! We’ll head through the jungle, hiking through well-groomed, easy trails that skirt the base of the Arenal Volcano.

Once you're done in the national park, you'll head to our very own Hunters & Gatherers restaurant where you will get to try delicious Costa Rican food that makes you feel good -- there are plenty of vegetarian options, gluten free, lacteos free and vegan, too, available. You'll love this fresh, amazing meal in one of La Fortuna's secret hangout at El Salto waterfall park.

Then, you'll finish the day at the stunning La Fortuna Waterfall. When you reach the entrance, you will have time to change into your bathing suit in case you want to cool off in the cool pools that flow from the waterfall. This is sure to be a good workout as there are 300 steps to get to the down to the waterfall, and 300 to get back up! When you reach the bottom, you'll have an opportunity to take lots of pictures and swim in the cool waters of one of the largest and most breathtaking waterfalls in Arenal!
