advice: "We are a company that prides itself in sound ecological and sustainable tourism practices. We adhere to Costa Rica National Park guidelines to stay on authorized paths and do not permit the extraction of plants or the feeding of wild animals.We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions."

Arenal Volcano National Park Hike and The Springs Spa Resort hot springs with Dinner

This is the quintessential Arenal Volcano tour to do when you’re in La Fortuna! The Arenal Volcano Rainforest and Natural History tour takes you through lush rainforest along the base of Costa Rica's most-famous, iconic volcano. Our experienced, bilingual naturalist guide will point out interesting plants and wildlife in the vibrant primary and secondary rainforest of the El Silencio nature reserve that skirts the Arenal Volcano National Park. You’ll then arrive to the observation point of the Arenal Volcano -- this is the closest you can get to the base of the Arenal Volcano -- and the perfect vantage point to take remarkable photos as the sun sets behind the Arenal Volcano.

Then it's time to head to The Springs Resort & Spa and enjoy a variety of hot springs pool in a luxurious 5-star resort with various restaurants, bars, locker-rooms and on-site wild cat reserve. Enjoy a delicious dinner at the resort before being transported back to your hotel in a Desafio van.
