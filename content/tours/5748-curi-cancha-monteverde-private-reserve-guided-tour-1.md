Curi Cancha Monteverde Private Reserve Guided Tour

You will want to choose the Curi Cancha Private Reserve in Monteverde if you're interested in getting a rare view of the elusive Resplendent Quetzal! Our guides for the Curi Cancha reserve use professional spotting scopes which help you view things you'd normally miss out on and have an uncanny ability to mimic and identify bird calls. Our guide will have your children looking harder for camouflaged animals in the wild than they would otherwise - like praying mantis, caterpillars, butterflies, spiders and bats. The Curi Cancha Reserve is a peaceful and awe-inspiring place to visit. Bring a good camera with a zoom lens.

Most people really like this reserve because it is known to be quieter than the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and you are bound to see different types of birds and animals. Keep your eyes peeled for birds like Trogons and the endangered Three-wattled Bellbird, animals like Agoutis and Coatis are very common and even reptiles like snakes that you don't usually see on the other reserves in Costa Rica. The trails are well-maintained covering a range of cloud forest and rainforest with many large epiphyte-festooned trees. In addition, there is an open meadow area where you're likely to see deer munching on blackberries!

The Curi Cancha reserve has hummingbird feeders where you can see a wide variety of other birds - one client reported seeing 7 species!

This guided hike comes highly recommended by our clients, but be sure to do it with a guide so you can see as much as you possibly can!
