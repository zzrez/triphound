advice: "One of the best Arenal tours for families visiting La Fortuna and those who want to take it easy on their vacation in Costa Rica. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!Remember we are at the mercy of Mother Nature. There may be times when we have to modify a tour to provide the safest adventure for you. The waterfall may have a large water flow with unfavorable conditions to swim, but the walk down is still worth the visit!"

Arenal COMBO Tour: Safari Float & La Fortuna Waterfall

We often get the question: What is the best combo for Families visiting the La Fortuna, Arenal Volcano area of Costa Rica? Those who want an up close encounter with nature -- and especially families -- visiting the Arenal area of Costa Rica will not want to miss out on this perfect nature combination tour. You get an easy-going safari float on one of the most beautiful rivers in the area, enjoy a local lunch and head out to the La Fortuna Waterfall for a refreshing swim. A Top 10 Arenal Tour for Nature Lovers!

We start out by picking you up from your hotel in the Arenal, Costa Rica area and drive about 30 minutes to the lush and easy-going Penas Blancas class 1 river. You will walk down a few steps to the banks of the river and get into an inflatable raft with your nature guide. It is a fun paddle session as you explore this jungle river and look up into the tree top canopy that surrounds the river to see caprichous monkeys swinging from the limbs and plentiful tropical birds making their calls.

You'll be treated to a visit to the farm of a local family who live along the riverside and you'll enjoy a nice homemade snack when you finish up the safari float.

From there, we'll drive about 30 minutes to our new Hunters & Gatherers Restaurant right next to the El Salto secret swimming hole so you can have a delicious and healthy Costa Rican lunch.

When you are ready, we then head another 10 minutes to the top of the La Fortuna Waterfall. There are restrooms, showers and changing facilities in this popular Arenal attraction. The La Fortuna Waterfall measures about 120 feet high with fresh, rushing waters that gush over the top of the mountain top covered in lush rainforest.

The hike down to the base of the La Fortuna waterfall takes about 20 minutes, so take your time. You can play around in the cool pools and enjoy the majesty of this amazing water feature.

The hike back up is about 300 steps, so just take in the beauty of the area the surrounds you.

This Arenal COMBO experience will literally leave you breathless!
