Monteverde 100% Aventura Superman Zipline

Experience what it feels like to fly as you soar high above the Cloud Forest Canopy in Monteverde on the longest and most EXTREME zipline in Latin America! Get a bird's eye view of the lush rainforest below as you glide Superman-style above the trees, then get your blood pumping with the ultimate adrenaline spike at the Tarzan Swing! By far one of the most exciting canopy zipline tours in Costa Rica, the 100% Aventura canopy zipline tour delivers exactly what its name promises: 100% adventure!

This is considered one of the best extreme ziplining tours in Costa Rica.

You'll be picked up from your hotel and brought to the cloud forest entrance where this incredible zipline through the clouds begins. After an equipment fitting and safety briefing with your highly trained tour guides, you'll zip across your very first cable and begin your extreme adventure! After a few shorter cables you'll reach the Big One: the longest zipline cable in Latine America, measuring 1590 meters (5216.5 ft!). The extensive cable gives you the opportunity to really enjoy the view as you fly above rolling hills and lush rainforest.

If you opt to try the Superman, you'll be suspended from your back as you soar above the cloud forest super-hero style, making every flying dream you've ever had a reality! And as if that isn't enough adventure, youÂ´ll have the choice to do the Tarzan Swing, a free-fall, bungie-like experience that swings to a height of 45 meters (148 ft). You'll leave with your legs shanking, your heart racing, and your eyes sparkling with adventure!
