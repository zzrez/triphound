Monteverde Extremo Park COMBO Zipline, Extreme Tarzan Swing, and Bungee Jump

Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime! This EXTREME Monteverde Extremo Park combo tour combines the absolute freedom of a zipline flight over the rainforest canopy with the exhilerating free-fall of a Tarzan Swing and the heart-pounding adrenaline rush of a 450 ft bungee jump above the trees. From start to finish, this combo tour is the ultimate Monteverde adrenaline package. You'll definitely want to write home about this Costa Rican adventure!

This is one adventure you don't want to go home without trying. Work your way across cables of increasing length until you get to The Big One: a cable measuring 1 kilometer (3281 ft)! Soar over the cloud forest of Monteverde, then dip down and zipline through a tunnel carved below one of the area's many mountains.

After experiencing the wonder of flight, jump from a platform 143 meters (469 ft) in the air and swing through the air in a free-fall Tarzan Swing. Your well-being is always the primary focus, so on this jump you will be tethered to safety with a double harness at both the chest and waist. Even so, your stomach will leap into your throat as you free fall and then pendulum swing over the gorgeous Monteverde rainforest canopy.

The adventure isn't over, however, because the best is yet to come: the 265 foot bungee jump. Leap from a tram suspended over the rainforest canopy and bungee 265 feet into the open air. Watch the canopy rush up to meet you as the wind whips past your face and you embrace the pull of gravity. Experience bungee jumping like never before as you dive over a breath-taking cload forest deep in the heart of Costa Rica.

The Monteverde Extremo Park COMBO Zipline, Swing and Bungee Jump Tour offers an unforgettable experience along with modern safety equipment, a safety briefing and tour instructions, experienced guides, a waterfall view, an exhilerating zipline tour along 14 cables -- five of which are extremely long, ranging from 425 meters to 1 kilometer (1394 to 3281 ft)-- a Tarzan Swing, and an incredible bungee jump above Monteverde's rainforest canopy.

With the lush green of Monteverde's rainforest canopy below you, experience the feeling of true freedom as you both fly and fall through the air. The exhileration of the zipline, Tarzan Swing, and bungee jump -- and for some, the conquering of fears -- will leave you feeling like a new person.
