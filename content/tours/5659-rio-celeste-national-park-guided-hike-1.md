You can also rent rubber boots for about $5 outside of the park entrance.Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

Rio Celeste National Park Guided Hike - In search of the blue waterfall in Costa Rica!

The Rio Celeste National Park is a beautiful 1.5 hour scenic drive from the Arenal Volcano through rural villages. The Río Celeste waterfall is near the Tenorio and Miravalles Volcanoes and is becoming an increasingly popular area to visit in Costa Rica for hiking. Once we arrive, we will begin a hike through the dense, lush, tropical rainforest that surrounds the Tenorio National Park. You and your nature guide can go at your own pace and you'll learn interesting things about the rainforest along the way.

When we arrive to Los Tenideros, where two rivers come together, you'll be amazed at the celestial turquoise blue water color that comes from the waterfall.

Local legend as explained by members of the Maleku indigenous group of the area claim that God was painting the sky a celestial blue color and reached down to dip his brush to turn the river its magical blue color.

But for a more scientific explanation, the celestial blue color is created when the inerals in the water: aluminum, silicon and oxygen are suspended in the water and refracts light from the sun so that the flow looks blue.

So get your cameras ready because this is the perfect place to take photos of this unforgettable Costa Rica blue waterfall!

We'll finish off with a delicious lunch at a local restaurant and then head back to La Fortuna as you relax in our Desafio vans. This Costa Rica hike takes about 1.5 to 2 hours or about 6 kms long (3 miles) and is considered a moderate hike.
