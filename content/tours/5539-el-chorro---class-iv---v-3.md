Departing from the Manuel Antonio and Quepos areas, your 40-minute drive winds past rural villages as you head deep into the lush river valley. At the tiny mountain town of Esquipulas, you receive safety instruction from an experienced guide before setting off on the upper section of the mighty Naranjo River.

Perfect for experienced rafters and thrill-seeking newbies alike, the rapids roar from the hills above Quepos and careen through a tight gorge in a breathtaking three-mile-long serpentine. Power through extreme narrows, bound around sharp turns with massive boulders and plummet down sudden drops. This trip is not for the faint-hearted!

Between intense rapid runs, enjoy smooth-flowing waters that allow you to take in the magnificent scenery. Riverbanks are rich with jungle greenery and home to an array of tropical birds including rainbow-billed toucans and brightly colored kingfishers. Ease past towering waterfalls and sheer rock walls that give way to vast stretches of unspoiled rainforest terrain. Take a breather to refresh with a snack and a beverage before paddling off for the ride’s big finish.

Having traversed extreme rapids including “Tail of the Dragon” and “El Chorro,” the last leg takes you through a canyon with soaring rock walls for a final amazing display of nature before you return to dry land.

Whitewater adventures await with an unforgettable river rafting trip that is sure to be a highlight of your visit to Costa Rica.
