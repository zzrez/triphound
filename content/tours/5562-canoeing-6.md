bring: "*   Women: bathing suit, shorts and t-shirt preferably with sleeves to protect them from the sun.
*   Men: swim trunks and t-shirt.
*   Everyone has to wear shoes, the options are: strap sandals (Teva, Keen); water shoes or tennis shoes (NEVER flip flops or sandals without a back)"
advice: "*   Take sun block, a hat, glasses (optional):
    Apply sun block on arms, the front of legs and the back of the neck moderately.  Don not apply sun block on the back of legs because when in contact with water it will become very slippery and will increase the chances of falling out of the raft; nor on the forehead because when in contact with water it may drip onto eyes causing irritation.*   If wanted, you may bring a hat to wear under the helmet.
    *   If glasses are taken they must have a device to secure them, like a strap.
*   Waterproof camera, bottle of water (optional).
*   Please do not take jewelry or valuable objects, because they might get lost in the river."

This tour starts on a private farm about 20 minutes from the town of Puerto Viejo and ends in the city of Puerto Viejo. You will be given a life jacket, helmet and a paddle… and yes you will be expected to paddle, a little. The guides will show you how to paddle and give you instructions on basic river safety. The section of the Puerto Viejo River you will run is class I (flat water) and is a great opportunity to float down through the pristine rainforest of the La Selva Biological Station. In this protected lowland tropical rainforest: you will be able to see howler monkeys, sloths, iguanas and all manner of birds which are often difficult to spot while hiking, including sunbitterns, toucans, herons, ospreys and more. This trip is a must for bird watchers. Depending on the water level, the tour lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Children & adults of all ages are welcome on this peaceful float as it is perfect for families. Canoes are recommended for the trip, but arrangements can also be made for duckies (inflatable kayak) or raft trips.
