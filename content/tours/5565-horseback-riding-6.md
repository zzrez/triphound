summary: "Only 10 minutes from our office on a private ranch you can enjoy a wonderful tour on horseback. Upon arrival you will be met by the head rancher who will accompany you throughout this journey. Once the horses are assigned to each group member you will be given an introductory talk on how to ride horses, in case you don’t have previous experience. Prior experience is not required whatsoever and it will not be a problem if you don&apos;t have any for this ride."
