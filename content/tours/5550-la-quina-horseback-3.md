A unique horseback riding adventure lies a short drive from both Jacó and Los Sueños. The La Quina Reserve offers tranquil treks through pristine rainforest to a hidden waterfall — and some unlikely jungle luxury.

Meet your Canadian equestrian experts — Shawna and Rob. The two animal lovers have created a one-of-a-kind sanctuary for creatures big and small. Much like the lovable dogs that call the refuge home, the horses on the verdant 1500-acre property are rescues. Humane care is a creed at the family-run farm. Horses only carry visitors every other day, free on their days off to roam the grounds and splash in their private swimming hole. No bridles with metal bits go into their mouths and no horseshoes are nailed, with hoofs protected by more-humane boots.

Riders are paired with horses according to skill and personality. Banjo is well trained but playful. Felicia is a gentle giant. With a name that translates to ”firecracker,” Polvera has the energy to match her handle. All the horses on the team are as pleasant as the loving care they receive and are suitable for most riders.

After some safety instruction, you’re off! The leisurely trip takes you through a variety of lush landscapes, across fields and through densely forested grounds. Along the way, you may pass a host of wildlife including deer, white-nosed coatis, iguanas and an amazing variety of tropical birds. Keep your eyes peeled for the brilliant blue morpho butterflies that flutter through the air.

You stop at a spot that makes you want to dash to your mobile device and post a rave TripAdvisor review. But instead, you simply admire the secluded waterfall that cascades to a natural pool of spring water. After a plunge, a dousing, a soak and a float, you emerge from the water to enjoy fruit from a box that’s been provided, along with some complimentary tea.

Ready for a decadent skin treatment? There’s a small container of volcanic ash to mix with mineral-rich mud and apply to your body. You’d pay top dollar for such an exotic treatment in a high-end spa, and not have the luxury of enjoying skin care in such serene surrounds. Rinse off and ride back with super soft skin and memories of a lifetime.

To the uninitiated, Stand-Up Paddleboards (or SUPs) are basically big steady surfboards that you stand on and paddle through the water. It’s fun, easy, and with some pointers from our instructors on Jacó Beach, you’ll be cruising across the calm ocean waters in no time.

For advanced zipliners and adventurous newbies, the Los Suenos Canopy Tour offers adrenaline-pumping rides at a rainforest retreat a short distance from Jacó Beach. Ascend to platforms with views over a waterfall, wildlife and the dramatic Nicoya Peninsula. Then soar down on a wild zip line ride that will make your adventure trip all the more memorable.
