With spectacular views, exciting terrain, a delicious, authentic Costa Rican meal and a trip to an exciting, 30 foot jump and swim waterfall, our 4-hour Tour de 7 Pueblos is our customer's favorite.

Experience kilometers of rainforest, beach views, cool waterfalls and exciting thrills with your own personal guide. The 4-Hour Signature Tour has it all!

Spectacular views & terrain, a 30 foot waterfall and a delicious, authentic Costa Rican meal make the 4-Hour ATV tour our best-seller.

Our Signature Tour is our half-day tour and covers amazing waterfalls, rivers, rainforest, countryside, small villages, hidden bars and restaurants.

Starting up the same trail as our Tour de la Paz, the half-day tour is a great ride covering the mountain ranges Agujas and getting our almost as far as Las Delicias.

Like The Tour de la Paz, the tour begins in the mountains directly behind Jaco, and continues roughly half the distance to the peak of the mountain.

We leave the ATVs and take a short walk to a beautiful 35ft. waterfall - a perfect spot for a jungle swim and some incredible pictures. If you are looking for a little extra adrenaline, the Waterfall Pura Vida also boasts a platform and several spots to jump in to the pools below.

After the brief stop, we continue up through primary rainforest and above the canopy to the top of the mountain range. Just beyond the crest of the mountain lies a beautiful mirador offering views of the ocean playing against sands as far south as Manuel Antonio, as far west as the Nicoya Peninsula, and as far north as the port city of Puntarenas.

We continue along the top of the mountain and through the rainforest towards the tranquil Pueblo of Bijagual.

Passing by the pueblo's church, soccer field and central saloon, we soon arrive at our delicious lunch destination - El Paz Del Campo (closed Tuesdays - delicious alternative offered).

The hidden Tilapia Farm and Restaurant provides not only some of the best authentic Costa Rican food you will have, it also offers an incredibly serene environment and the fun of fishing the tilapia fish right from the gazebo above the pool that surrounds. Let the kids grab a stick to fish with and try their and try their luck in the little pond - great fun for the kids!

Some of the best authentic Costa Rican food you will have...and the fun of fishing the tilapia fish right from the pool that surrounds
