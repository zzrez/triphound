advice: "For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Sky Adventures Gondola with Guided Hanging Bridges in Monteverde

Start your day off with a relaxing ride in an open-air gondola Sky Tram trip above the cloud forest canopy. The spectacular view will get wider and more breathtaking as you get higher up onto the mountains. Your knowledgeable naturalist guide will educate you about Costa Rica’s nature and wildlife, while pointing out tropical birds and wildlife species. You can stop the gondola at any time on your way up to take some good pictures and really soak in what you are seeing.

When you reach the observation platform at the top, you’ll realize that you really are in the middle of paradise. Next, head back down from the mountain and begin your forest adventure with the most innovative way to hike through the forest - the Sky Walk hanging bridges!

Designed for bird-watchers and nature lovers alike, the hanging bridges offer stunning views of the cloud forest and it’s inhabitants. Walk across a series of five bridges, spanning over 1.5 miles, and up to 100 meters long with your naturalist guide who will point out wildlife, plant species and offer fun facts about Costa Rica! What a wonderful way to spend some quality time with Mother Nature!
