Intermediate to Advanced Riders - total elevation +2,057 ft / -2,061 ft

This ride starts off the same as the half loop ride, only it continues on! We will start at the Bike Arenal office, from there we ride through the village of Guaria, then down across the Rio Arenal and continue on to climb the hilly surface of Monterrey. On a clear day you can even see all the way to Nicaraguan lake at the top of the ride! The total distance of this ride is approximately 30km, and if you are up for it, the lake is only an extra 9km away! Half way through the ride we will stop for a snack break with some refreshing fruit, granola bars and drinks, as well as the ability to get a full water bottle for the rest of the ride. This ride has some big climbs that will push your legs and get your heart racing! A fun challenge for the more advanced riders!
