advice: "Tour departures are tide-dependent. Please check with Samara Adventure Company for exact departure time. We may have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone (1-8pax) – please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing. For Nosara or Punta Islita Beaches: extra charge $30 per person. Some of our tours have Min. 2 or 4 pax – please call us to see if we can make an exception.

For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."
