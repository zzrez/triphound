advice: "This Arenal Volcano hike Costa Rica is operated in the Arenal Volcano National Park in the morning tour and the 1968 Trail for the afternoon for better wildlife viewing.We are a company that prides itself in sound ecological and sustainable tourism practices. We adhere to Costa Rica National Park guidelines to stay on authorized paths and do not permit the extraction of plants or the feeding of wild animals.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions."

Arenal Volcano National Park and Arenal Reserve Guided Hike

The Arenal Volcano National Park and other reserves along the border of the National Park are one of the most visited places in all of Central America. The trails in Arenal National Park and other nearby Arenal Reserves are generally flat and not very strenuous -- perfect for a leisurely and informative hike with one of our professional nature guides.

We’ll start the tour off by picking you up at your hotel and driving to the entrance of the Arenal National Park (if your tour is in the morning) or to the 1968 Trail for afternoon tours.

You can use the facilities and read up on the history of the area before your guided walk. Then we’ll hike through well-groomed, easy trails that skirt the base of the Arenal Volcano and Lake Arenal Area.

This part of the Arenal Volcano had sections that were devastated by the lava flow of 1968, so some areas have very little vegetation.

If you are interested, you may ask your guide to show you the dried lava flow from a smaller eruption that happened in 1992.

This guided walk of the Arenal Volcano National Park or 1968 Trail provides perfect photo opportunities and magnificent views of the impressive Arenal Volcano, the pristine Lake Arenal and the extinct volcano Cerro Chato.

We have chosen the appropriate trails (Arenal Volcano National Park or the 1968 Trail) for each tour time for better wildlife viewing. There are parts of each trail that has forested areas where your nature guide will try to spot birds, monkeys and other animals in their natural habitat.

Kids, families and all nature lovers enjoy this Arenal Volcano tour for the gorgeous views and opportunities for wildlife viewing.
