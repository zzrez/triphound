Manuel Antonio Catamaran Boat Tour

We will sail out into the open ocean and search for spotted dolphins, whales and colorful tropical fish. Your guide will tell you about the area and all of the interesting creatures that live there. You'll see the rugged terrain and cliffs in the Manuel Antonio National Park that are actually a nesting ground for many types of marine bird species like pelicans, boobies and ibises. When we reach a quiet cove the captain will anchor the boat and you will have a chance to go snorkeling through the coral reefs. We will provide high quality snorkeling equipment and brief you on what to look for underwater. You will be amazed at more than 50 different species of underwater sea creatures.

Afterwards, come back on board and enjoy a delicious lunch on the ocean complete with pasta salad, homemade pesto, fresh tropical fruit, homemade flan, natural juices, coffee and cocktails.
