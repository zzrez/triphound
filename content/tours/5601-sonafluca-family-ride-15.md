This is the perfect ride for the family or people who donï¿½t ride often! Fun, educational and even offers a chance to swim! Start right from town at the main office and head out into the countryside. You will weave through small communities on back roads, seeing plantains of papaya, cassava, potato, sugar cane and more!

On this ride you will see 7 different communities! We will start out in Fortuna, then pass through Agua Azul, El Tanque, into Sona Fluca where we will stop for a swim in the beautiful Fortuna River. After cooling down we will get back onto our bikes and carry on! Right on cue for when we start to warm up again we will pass through Tres Esquinas where you can choose to ride through the Burro River.

At this point you can choose if you want to keep on riding up the final 7km back to the office which is a steep ride on a main road, or hop in the support vehicle back to the office.
