advice: "We have created these fun Arenal COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your Arenal COMBO logistics.Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our adventure tour policies..

Recommended ages 13-60. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours.NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up

ZONE 1: 1-22 pax: No extra charge

ZONE 2: Lost Iguana, Observatory Lodge, Arenal Lodge & The Springs Resort: $20 per trip or $40 roundtrip. ZONE 3: Rancho Margot, Linda Vista, Arenal Vista: $25; $50 rndtrp

ZONE 4: Leaves & Lizards, V. Hermosa, Tilajari: $35/trip; $70 rndtrp"

Arenal COMBO Tour: Canyoning & Ziplining

Come see the lush Costa Rican rainforest from two different perspectives! Get wet and wild hiking through the forest and rappelling down waterfalls, then soar above the rainforest canopy as you zipline from tree to tree like Tarzan! This day is full of adventure and is the perfect way to get to know the REAL Costa Rican jungle!

Canyoneering is more than just rappelling; it’s a full-body work out! Use your arms, legs, and hands to climb through Mother Nature’s obstacle course: You’ll be jumping into pools, sliding down a natural water slide, sitting under waterfalls, pulling yourself up some rocks and helping yourself down others. You’ll finish your adventure with a 200 ft waterfall drop -- rappelling part of the way and then letting go of the reins to experience a guided free fall drop! Talk about adrenaline!

Then, relax and enjoy a delicious lunch at the Lost Canyon Café for the famous DESAFIO WARRIOR BUFFET before heading to your ziplining adventure with delicious options including vegetarian and other dietary needs.

We will then take you back to your hotel for a quick break (you can request to stay in the La Fortuna downtown area) where you wait to be picked-up for your next adventure... the quintessential ziplining in Costa Rica!

There are 13 cables in total that reach up to 430 meters long - that's over 1,200 feet long! During this canopy zipline tour in Arenal, you will find yourself high above the rainforest canopy with amazing views of the surrounding hills, mountains, rivers and the majestic Arenal Volcano forming the best picturesque backdrop. This Arenal COMBO tour with canyoning and ziplining is sure to get your heart racing and is one of our most-popular Arenal COMBO tour options.
