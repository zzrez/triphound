Experienced rafters and adrenaline-loving newbies alike will love the whitewater rapids that await on the Naranjo River. Roaring from the coastal mountains above Quepos, the waterway features fast and often frenzied Class IV rapids.

Your roughly four-hour ride snakes through a slew of geological wonders. Blast past towering canyon walls that drop sheer faces to the water’s edge. Twist around rocky bends and craggy curves through dramatic gorges. The jaw-rattling run finally settles as you float toward the Pacific Ocean.

But it isn’t all white waves and rushing currents along a rockbound route. Between the dramatic Class IV stretches you’ll glide past lush riverbanks covered by pristine jungle flora. Keep an eye out for an amazing variety of birds including keel-billed toucans, ringed kingfishers, and white ibises. Enjoy scenic views of wide palm plantations and fertile farmland. But keep wary — raging rapids could lie around each new bend.

That depends on the adventure you seek. Rushing waters are more intense when the levels rise during Costa Rica’s green season from May to October. During the rainest part of our green season, the river is often only available with the morning start time - an agent will advise you at booking. The Naranjo river closes during our dry season each year.

After your thrilling ride, a tranquil stroll through nature sounds like a good idea. The Naranjo River forms the southern boundary of Manuel Antonio National Park. Walk sandy tree-shaded paths through cool lowland rainforest, pausing to take in waterfalls and diverse wildlife.

Board a boat for a scenic cruise along a series of mangrove-lined canals that wind through lush rainforest. Onshore you’re likely to spot sloths lazing in trees. You’re guaranteed to see a variety of tropical birds and a host of playful monkeys that call the forest home.

Set off from Jacó for a brief but breathtaking ATV tour. Minutes after leaving town you’ll be tearing up a nature trail on an ascension to lookout points over the Pacific Ocean and Nicoya Peninsula. Cruise along mountain passes through rainforest terrain, stopping to view a waterfall and enjoy a beverage at a hideaway restaurant.

However you pair your river rafting, you’re guaranteed to enjoy a unique nature getaway and the adventure trip of a lifetime.
