advice: "For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."

Kingfisher Sportfishing is our favorite fishing outfitter on the Pacific Coast. Rick and Jackie are excellent hosts and know all the secret places. The other day we ate a delicious fresh tuna at El Colibri Restaurant in Carrillo that was caught earlier that day. Simply amazing!

This area is primarily a billfish destination and their Kingfisher 31 foot Palm Beach with full electronics, tower and outriggers is the ideal fishing machine for the calm pacific waters off of Playa Carrillo. It offers ample shade and room for up to 4 anglers, she is set up for the serious fisherman as well as the novice angler.

And don't miss out on their Boat, Bed & Breakfast special. They have a lovely 6-bedroom rental home complex near Carrillo Beach and if you book the boat, we can help you get a good deal on renting their home with all the fixings, including a delicious breakfast everyday.
