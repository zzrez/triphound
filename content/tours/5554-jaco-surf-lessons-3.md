Native Costa Rican ex-pro surfers are the heart and soul of Adventure Tours’ Jaco Surf Lessons.

With more than 25 years of local surfing instruction, experience, and passion – no one is better suited to get you up and surfing on your first day!

Adventure Tours’ Jaco surf lessons provide the highest quality surf instruction in the Jacó, Los Suenos and Hermosa area.

With the best learning wave in the country - Jaco Costa Rica, and the most widely-respected instructors in the area, Adventure Tours’ Jaco surf lessons provide the highest quality surf instruction in the Jacó, Los Suenos and Hermosa area.

Safety and preparation are the most important components to great surf instruction. For that reason every Jaco surf lesson begins with instruction on the basics of surfing, water safety, surfing etiquette, wave dynamics, paddling, wave position, stretching and standing up on the board.

Arrive at the beach in style in our surf-rigged Yamaha Rhino Side-By-Side. Transportation, drinks, board rental and instruction are all included in your lesson. We welcome all levels of students from beginner to intermediate to our Jaco surf lessons.
