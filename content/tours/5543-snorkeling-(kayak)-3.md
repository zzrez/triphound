Not all Kayaking tours are equal – of that you can be certain. You can also be certain that when you book a kayaking tour with Adventure Tours Costa Rica, you are booking a half-day adventure of unparalleled fun in the sun in the warn Pacific waters surrounding Playa Agujas.

With top of the line equipment, which includes our own line of lightweight, bamboo paddles, professional, bilingual guides and over 15 years of Costa Rican kayaking experience, we will lead your group on a well-plotted adventure where the spectacular scenery along the way is just as exhilarating as the exotic destination we will arrive upon. Shimmering waters, lush fauna, gorgeous views and indigenous wildlife await you on this exciting excursion.

When weather conditions permit, you may enjoy snorkeling from the beach. Other activities may include beachcombing and monkey or bird watching as a part of your tour with us. Please note that we will only snorkel when the conditions are proper.

No experience is necessary! This tour is open to experienced kayakers and adventurous first-timers alike.
