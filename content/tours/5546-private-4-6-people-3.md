Beat the crowds of tourists arriving on the catamarans from far-away Puntarenas on your own private tour of Tortuga Island...

This first-class cruise leaving from the Marriott Los Suenos Marina takes you through the majestic Gulf of Nicoya. The trip to Tortuga Island is less than an hour on this top-of-the-line 26-foot center console twin-engine Regulator.

Dolphins, sailfish, and even the humpback whale are just a few examples of the marine life you have a chance to see along the way. On our Tour of Tortuga Island, there are a variety of activities to enjoy. Snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, or just simply relaxing in the warm sun with a cool drink are among the favorites.

Delicious food, fruits and drinks are all prepared for you by the Marriott Marina’s favorite restaurant - The Hook Up. And, of course, a friendly bilingual crew is always with you to ensure that your experience on Tortuga Island and in the Gulf of Nicoya is a memorable one.
