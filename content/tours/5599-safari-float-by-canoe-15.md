Guided float downriver by canoe. Enjoy both the pace and the peace of the river and its surrounding rainforest. Among the rich diversity of wildlife at Rio Pe√±as Blancas we find green iguanas, howler monkeys, sloth, egrets and herons. You will enjoy lunch by the river, followed by a short paddle down the San Carlos river to a meeting point, from where you will be taken back to your hotel.
