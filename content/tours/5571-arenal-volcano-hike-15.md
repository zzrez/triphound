After we pick you up from the location of your choice we will head towards Lake Arenal. The 4km hike takes place on the 1968 private reserve. Named after the multi-day eruption of Arenal Volcano in 1968, this whole area was covered in ash, lava, and other volcanic debris, in the 50 years since, the jungle has reclaimed the area. Although it is now a new growth forest much of the lava rock and flow are still visible, half way through the hike there is less new growth leaving the trail much more exposed (make sure to wear sunscreen).

The end of the hike continuously gets steeper as you walk up what seem to be naturally made lava steps to reach the trail summit. After the short climb you are rewarded with beautiful views of the volcano as well as Lake Arenal! (Weather dependent).

During the hike your knowledgeable guides will give you information about the fauna, flora and any animals you come across. They will also share even more history of the volcano and the area that was affected by the unexpected event! A great way to learn about the power of nature!
