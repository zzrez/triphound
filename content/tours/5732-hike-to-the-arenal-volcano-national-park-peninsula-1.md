Hike to the Arenal Volcano National Park Peninsula

Hike to the Arenal Volcano National Park Penninsula to catch the feeding time of the plethora of birds in this cradle of wildlife at the foot of the Arenal Volcano along the shores of Lake Arenal.

There are amazing birding opportunities around the Arenal Volcano National Park and especially at the new Arenal National Park trail at the Park’s Peninsula lake Arenal trail. Your enthusiastic nature guide will likely be able to spot a variety of birds such as the Green Honeycreeper, Crimson-collared, Scarlet-rumped, Hepatic and Passerine's Tanagers and much more!

Our favorite are the Orange-bellied Trogon and the Violet-headed Hummingbird near the entrance of the park. Off in the distance, you’ll be able to hear the pecking away of the Smoky-brown or Golden-olive Woodpecker while some noisy Crested Guans will be mulling around in some of the trees nearby. And you’ll be amazed to see the plethora of hanging nests of the Montezuma Oropendolas.

Our guides have spotted several White-throated Magpie Jay and Rufous-tailed Jacamar, as well as a variety of Flycatchers.you won’t want to miss out on the colorful Violaceous Trogon and interesting selection of Motmots, such as the Broad-billed Motmot, Rufous Motmot and even Keel-billed Motmot (not to be mistaken for a Keel-billed Toucan!). And then at Lake Arenal, you’ll see the Gray-headed Kites soaring overhead with an occasional White Hawk or Ornate Hawk-Eagle!

Aside from birding, this new trail is also great to spot the three variety of monkeys in the Arenal Volcano Area: Howler, Spider, Capuchin Monkeys.

Be sure to check out our boat or Stand Up Paddle or kayaking tour plus the Peninsula hike options to maximize your visit to the Arenal Volcano Costa Rica. So if you are still trying to figure out what to do in Arenal, be sure to pick this Peninsula Hike at the Arenal National Park.
