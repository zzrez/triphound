advice: "Click here to check out the Single Track Madness video or have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies. Come and bike Arenal with us!

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our company policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition to attempt it. NOTE: We have an extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone."
