Guanacaste Day Tour: Rio Celeste National Park & Tenorio Volcano Guided Hike

Legend has it that after God was done painting the sky, he washed his paintbrushes in a river that now called Rio Celeste (Light Blue River). Hike through the lush rainforest, the home to an abundance of wildlife- from sloths, birds, iguanas and plenty of interesting insects and admire views of the Tenorio volcano. After, enjoy a delicious traditional Costa Rican lunch before heading back to your hotel!

Please note: the RÃ­o Celeste waterfall may lose its blue color during rainstorms. Our policy is to advise clients the day of the tour if it is raining in the area and offer the tour for the following day, should clients want to postpone or change to a different tour. No refunds for inclement weather. Swimming is not permitted in the river.
