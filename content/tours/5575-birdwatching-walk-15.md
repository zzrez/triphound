Birds are one of the groups of animals where the enormous biodiversity of Costa Rica is more evident. Join us for an easy bird watching walk, where we�ll spot and identify a wide variety of species. We regularly see toucans, parrots, oropendolas, colorful tanagers and hummingbirds. Every day we are also surprised by some of the unusual species in the area like antbirds, euphonias, egrets and others.

The tour includes a bird list and a short discussion on the species we have seen and their families.
