bring: "*   Women: bathing suit, shorts and t-shirt preferably with sleeves to protect them from the sun.
*   Men: swim trunks and t-shirt.
*   Everyone has to wear shoes, the options are: strap sandals (Teva, Keen); water shoes or tennis shoes (NEVER flip flops or sandals without a back)."
advice: "*   Apply sun block on arms, the front of legs and the back of the neck moderately.  Don not apply sun block on the back of legs because when in contact with water it will become very slippery and will increase the chances of falling out of the raft; nor on the forehead because when in contact with water it may drip onto eyes causing irritation.
*   If wanted, you may bring a hat to wear under the helmet.
*   If glasses are taken they must have a device to secure them, like a strap."

Traveling on pneumatics (tubes) through rivers is an activity practiced by many rural areas of the country and Sarapiquí is a great example of that, that’s why we offer you the opportunity to enjoy this fun and safe activity. For this activity we have picked the Sardinal River, a section that begins in the Palmitas community and ends in the facilities of the La Quinta Hotel. The whole run is 4 kilometers long with class I and II rapids, in other words very easy.

The equipment that we use is a pneumatic or tube which has been specially designed for the activity, with safety handles and a special system designed so that once placed in the river, the tube will not tip over, which makes it very stable and safe. We will provide you with all the necessary safety equipment that you will need, and a qualified guide will accompany you throughout the duration of the tour, which will last approximately for 2 hours.
