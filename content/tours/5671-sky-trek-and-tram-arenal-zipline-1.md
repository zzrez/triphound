Get lifted high onto a mountain by an open-air gondola to an observation platform where you will witness breathtaking views of the cloud forest! Then get your adrenaline pumping as you begin your journey “zipping” above the rainforest canopy!"

advice: "Weight and size restrictions: Max 270 pounds with a maximum waist of 42 inches (120 cm) and maximum thigh of 31.5 inches (80 cm).Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 270 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 270 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 270 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."
