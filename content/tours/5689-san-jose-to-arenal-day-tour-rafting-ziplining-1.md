advice: "We have created these fun COMBO tours to help you economize time and money on your vacation - we will coordinate your tour pick-ups and drop-offs and in some COMBOs, you may have a short break back at your hotel to take a breather before the next tour. Please keep your itinerary with you so you are aware of your COMBO logistics.

Recommended ages 13-60. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

San Jose to Arenal Day Tour: Rafting and Ziplining

After getting picked up from your hotel, weâ€™ll drive through the beautiful Costa Rican hills and mountains.

True to the Desafio name, which means "challenge" in Spanish, you will indeed challenge yourself as you paddle down 10 kilometers of exciting rapids with names like "Congo Loco" and "Rock around the Croc". As you descend down this beautiful class 2-3 river, you will have a chance to admire the lush greenery, vines, and different types of insects, birds and animals. Your eagle-eyed guides will point out the monkeys, sloths,and toucans along the way! When you are finished, use our private change rooms and showers and get ready to have a delicious lunch. You will be served a delicious typical Costa Rican meal and have an opportunity to see and purchase photos from your rafting experience.

Afterwards, as we start heading back to San Jose we will stop in the beautiful cloud forest and head on your next adventure- ziplining. This canopy tour has 12 exciting runs through the cloud forest, the last one being the famous superman ride which zips you head first across a valley and provides amazing aerial views of the surrounding mountains, rivers and land. When you are done, we'll head back to San Jose and drop you back off at your hotel.
