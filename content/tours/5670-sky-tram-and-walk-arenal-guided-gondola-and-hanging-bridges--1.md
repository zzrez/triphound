advice: "Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our adventure tour policies.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition!"

Sky Adventures Gondola and Hanging Bridges Guided Tour

Start your day off with a relaxing ride in an open-air gondola. The breathtaking view will get wider and more breathtaking as you get higher up onto the mountain. Your knowledgeable naturalist guide will educate you about Costa Rica’s nature and wildlife, while pointing out tropical birds and wildlife species.

You can stop the gondola at any time on your way up to take some good pictures and really soak in what you are seeing. This is an excellent opportunity for birdwatchers.

When you reach the observation platform at the top, you’ll realize that you really are in the middle of paradise.

Next, head back down from the mountain and begin your forest adventure with the most innovative way to hike through the forest - the hanging bridges! Designed for bird-watchers and nature lovers alike, the hanging bridges offer stunning views of the cloud forest and it’s inhabitants. Walk across a series of bridges with your naturalist guide who will point out wildlife, plant species and offer fun facts about Costa Rica! What a wonderful way to spend some quality time with Mother Nature! Sky Adventures is located near La Fortuna.
