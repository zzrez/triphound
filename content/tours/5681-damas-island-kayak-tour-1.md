Damas Island Kayak Tour

Once you settle into your kayak we will head out on the Paquita River and float along the soft currents in the shading mangrove estuary. Keep an eye out for monkeys, snakes, birds and ant eaters! You will see interestingly formed land made from trees growing above the water, leaving their roots exposed and forming tunnels that you can paddle through. You will have a choice of single or double kayaks so even beginners and children can enjoy this tour.
