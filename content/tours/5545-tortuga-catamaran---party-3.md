The perfect excursion for groups ready to enjoy a first-class, island experience complete with free rum punch and margaritas

Conveniently docked at the world-famous Los Suenos Marina within the Los Suenos Resort, your day will begin with a simple breakfast of tropical fruit served with fresh-baked muffins and delicious, Costa Rican coffee, served to you by our friendly, bilingual crew as your board the catamaran for Tortuga.

On your cruise to Tortuga Island, sun-lovers may choose to enjoy the views from the open-air seating, which is available on deck. Air-conditioned, indoor seating is also available, featuring large, port and starboard windows to assure an excellent view of the Pacific while inside. Either way, your group will have a chance at seeing our amazing marine life, which includes sailfish, dolphins, even the occasional humpback whale!

Once the catamaran arrives at Tortuga Island, your group will find plenty of fun ways to spend your day. An included Eco hike through the rainforest will connect you with the island’s pristine nature, which includes iconic coconut trees, exotic birds, tropical flowers and even a pet pig named Filomena! Also included in your trip are a snorkeling excursion and a free banana boat ride each. The island offers a variety of watersport rentals, which include wave runners, kayaks, paddle boards, and paddle boats, all of which may be purchased separately at a reasonable price. If lounging is more your speed, you’ll find the included beach chairs and oversized umbrellas offer the perfect vantage point to kick back with a cold drink and watch the waves roll in.

A delicious, fresh-cooked lunch of chicken and rice, potatoes, two different salads and chips round out this tropical day that your group will talk about for years to come.

If you have been looking for the perfect tropical beach day with your active, fun-seeking group, the Tortuga Island Catamaran Party Tour can't be beat!
