advice: "We are a company that prides itself in sound ecological and sustainable tourism practices. We adhere to Costa Rica National Park guidelines to stay on authorized paths and do not permit the extraction of plants or the feeding of wild animals.Extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone. Please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing. For Nosara or Punta Islita Beaches: extra charge $30.

For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical conditions!"

One Day Tour Guanacaste to the Arenal Volcano & Hot Springs with Dinner

We'll pick you up from your hotel in Guanacaste and drive through the gorgeous Costa Rican backroads to the Arenal Volcano.

Hike through lush rainforest with an experienced naturalist guide who will point out interesting plants and wildlife in the primary and secondary rainforest that lines the base of the Arenal Volcano. Youâ€™ll then arrive at the observation point -- the closest you can get to the base of the volcano.

What better way to relax after your hike than in a natural hot spring? The natural geothermal heat created by the volcano heats the groundwater to form these enjoyable hot springs. Finish this perfect day off with a delicious dinner and free time to explore the famous town of La Fortuna.
