Relax and enjoy a day of heightened emotions on the quiet waters of the Peñas Blancas. You will be in full contact with nature as you will be able to experience close contact with many species of birds, monkeys, sloth�s, iguanas, crocodiles and more.

Along the way we will stop to spend time with a typical Costa Rican farmer and his family. They will prepare some wonderful Tico dishes for you as they share their life story. We also enjoy the rare opportunity to explore, and learn more about the many riches of the virgin tropical rainforest on their farm. Finally, it�s back to the river to continue our float to the small town of Boca Arenal.
