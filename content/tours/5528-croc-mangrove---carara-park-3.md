If you are looking for an all-inclusive day trip from San Jose, Jaco Beach, Los Suenos Resort, or Puntarenas filled with exotic wildlife in Costa Rica’s National Parks, and incredibly diverse Mangroves – Look no further. Just reserve, relax and Adventure Tours Costa Rica will take care of the rest.

No need to find us, we pick you up right from your hotel or accommodations and drive you straight to the famous Crocodile Boat Tour in the Mangroves of the Tarcoles River. Birders from all over the world come to Costa Rica to see the amazing diversity of wildlife that is attracted to the Tarcoles mangroves.

This river delta is one of the most popular tours for nature-lovers who are also up for the thrill of a little crocodile show from a safe distance. With over two-thousand crocs living at the mouth of this river, Tarcoles is home to the largest concentration of crocs per square kilometer in all of Central America. Not to worry, this tour is PERFECTLY SAFE, and sees tens of thousands of visitors every year.

After enjoying your crocodile boat safari portion of your Costa Rica day trip, you’ll enjoy a hearty Costa Rican “casado” – the traditional Costa Rican meal of chicken, fish, pork or beef accompanied by rice, black beans, salad and fried plantain accompanied by freshly-squeezed natural juice. Once you have enjoyed your delicious meal, you are on your way to Carara National Park.

Carara is one of Costa Rica’s most popular National Parks. Carara’s uniqueness in species and fauna is due to the fact that it lies in a transitional zone separating the Pacific rainforest from the northwestern tropical dry forests. A birders paradise, Carara is home to more than 400 species of birds. You will also have the chance to see armadillos, anteaters, agoutis, sloths, white-faced monkeys, howler monkeys, spider monkeys, iguanas, white-nosed coatis, basilisks (jesus lizards), and many other species that inhabit its varying ecosystems. You will experience it all with your group’s personal bilingual and tourism board-certified naturalist guide.

After your great Costa Rica day trip of experiencing Costa Rica’s natural paradise, you are back on the bus for refreshments and back at your hotel in time for dinner.
