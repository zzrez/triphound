advice: "Extra transport charge for hotels outside of our normal pick-up zone. Please inquire to confirm hotel pick-up time and pricing. For Nosara or Punta Islita Beaches: extra charge $30.

Recommended ages 8-65. For reasons beyond our control (climate, river levels, etc.), we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run. This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition! While the recommended weight limit for our canyoneering (rappelling) tour and most zip line tours is 220 lbs (100 kilos) it’s more about waist size than weight as the ropes (canyoneering) and cables (zip lines) are rated for well over 220 lbs but the maximum waist size for the harnesses used for these tours is 42 inches. So if you are a little over 220 lbs but your waist is less than 42 inches you can still do these tours."

Guanacaste Day Tour: Monteverde Sky Adventures Ziplining & Lunch

Come see the Costa Rica cloud forest in Monteverde from new heights- literally! We’ll pick you up from your Guanacaste hotel and take you on a rather long drive to Sky Trek Adventure’s headquarters in Monteverde to embark on an adventure of a lifetime!

Start your day off with a scenic ride up a mountain by an open-air gondola. The breathtaking view will get wider and more breathtaking as you get higher up onto the mountain. When you reach the observation platform at the top, you’ll realize that you really are in for a treat. There, you will begin your adrenaline-pumping journey zipping through the rainforest: flying like a bird from tree-to-tree and canyon-to-canyon through 1.7 miles of zipline cables! Admire the amazing nature on your journey across 8 cables that reach up to 660 feet and are up to 2460 feet long. You won’t want to miss out on an adventure like this!

Then relax and have a nice lunch before returning to your hotel.
