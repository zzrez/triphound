Guanacaste COMBO Day Tour: Borinquen Zipline, Horseback, Hot Springs & Mud Baths

Enjoy an exciting horseback ride through the mountains, admiring the views of Guanacaste’s Pacific coast and Rincon de la Vieja Volcano. Then, strap on your harness and prepare yourself for a thrilling adventure zip lining above the rainforest treetops, while having a chance to see the Borinquen Waterfall from a birds perspective! Fuel up with a delicious traditional Costa Rican lunch and head to the hotsprings where you will be able to relax and reminisce about your exciting adventure! The hotsprings host a series of hot and cold pools, all a variety of sizes and temperatures, heated by a nearby volcanic fumerole. And when you are ready, treat your skin to a soothing and pampering mudbath: cover your whole body with mud, let it dry, and see how much smoother and refreshed your skin is. This day is one of the highlights of many people’s vacations and one of the best things to do in Guanacaste.
