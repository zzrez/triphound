advice: "Some of our tours on the beach are tide-dependent and starting times may vary based on weather conditions. Please feel free to stop in at our office in the center of Playa Samara at Samara Adventure Company to confirm departure times and learn more about our tour options. See you soon in Costa Rica!

For events that could happen beyond our control we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."

Dolphin Sightseeing with Snorkeling in Playa Samara

Feel the fresh ocean breeze and see stunning views of the Pacific coastline along Playa Samara as we head out to sea in a motorized catamaran and search for dolphins and other kinds of sea life! In the past there have been sightings of Spotted Dolphins, Central American Spinner Dolphins, Common Bottle-nosed Dolphins and Humpback and Blue whales. During certain parts of the year, killer whales also appear! After some time out at sea, we will head to Isla Chora, a small island just off of the coast of Samara. There, you will have a chance to explore underwater and be amazed at the tropical fish of all colors- blue, purple, yellow, red - as well as octopus, blowfish and porcupine fish! You can then walk around the island’s beach, enjoy some fresh tropical fruit, and relax and soak up some rays before heading back to mainland where you will be driven back to your hotel.
